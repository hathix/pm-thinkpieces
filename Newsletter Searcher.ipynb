      "['One of the clearest examples of healthcare’s backwardness is the lack of control patients have over their own health data. In today’s world, we take data access for granted in other industries — being able to send documents from one person to another, to aggregate meetings from multiple calendars into a single view, or to manage several bank accounts using a single app. It’s hard to imagine a similar experience in healthcare. Just the other day, a friend of mine was trying to figure out if she’d gotten all her tetanus shots when she was younger. It should’ve been a simple question, but the only answer I could think of was for her to call every single primary care provider she’s had since childhood and ask for her vaccination records. At that point, it would’ve been a coin flip as to whether they would fax the info or use the groundbreaking new technology of email. We’re going to dive into this issue today and look at how things work today as well as the slow changes taking place. If you follow digital health closely, you may have heard that earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released new guidelines regarding interoperability of medical data. We’ll talk about what those new rules mean and how they unlock opportunities for innovation. And just a quick disclaimer upfront — although I have a high level understanding of how APIs work, I’m not a software engineer, so I apologize if some of my terminology usage is not technically 100% accurate. Patients today have minimal direct access to EHRs How EHRs work today Whenever you visit a clinic or hospital as a patient, you generate medical data during your visit with your provider. After your visit, your provider inputs this data into their electronic health record (EHR), which is used both for their own record keeping purposes and for reimbursement claims. The way things are today, you have little ability to read data directly from, or write data to, your own EHR file. If you want to look up test results from a specific date, or if you want to add a new medical update to you file, you have to do it through your provider. This may only be a minor inconvenience normally, but it starts to become a major issue if your care is fragmented. Let’s say all of your primary care is done through a company like One Medical , but you get into an emergency where you need to go to an ER for the first time. How do you make sure the ER gets accurate information on your pre-existing conditions, allergies, and medications? Or what if you prefer telemedicine visits over physical visits for routine check-ups. How can you make sure the notes from your virtual visits are passed along to your primary care provider when you finally visit them in person? These situations demonstrate that the lack of direct data access for patients isn’t simply an inconvenience; it can hinder quality of care. New HHS rules promote interoperability and patient EHR access Empowering patients to have more control over their health data is one of the few bipartisan issues left in Washington, and as such, it was included in the 21st Century Cures Act which was passed in December 2016. On March 9, 2020, HHS finalized a set of new rules to implement the relevant provisions from this Act. The rules tackle the issue of health data access through 3 main approaches: First, the rules prohibit a practice known as “information blocking”, where EHR vendors actively put up barriers that hinder access to health records in their databases. Historically, many EHR vendors have used “proprietary” formats for storing patient information instead of established standards, to make it difficult for customers to transfer data to competing products or to switch over to competitors. The new HHS rules ban these approaches and instead require EHR databases to meet a set of interoperability standards to ensure that information transferred between EHRs can be mutually understood. Second, the rules require EHRs to publish application programming interfaces (APIs) that third-party app developers can use to access health data, with patient consent. With this change, developers will be able to build applications that give patients much more direct access to their medical records than they have today. These APIs must follow standard formats as well. Third, the rules require hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs to proactively send electronic notifications to other providers when patients are admitted, discharged, or transferred. This change is geared at ensuring continuity of information in cases where care is fragmented or where patients change providers. It’s time to build… consumer EHRs It’s rare to be able to find startup ideas by reading government guidelines, but in this case, HHS was pretty explicit in calling out the opportunities they foresee with these changes. Their press release reads: “As a result of this rule, patients will be able to securely and easily obtain and use their electronic health information from their provider’s medical record for free, using the smartphone app of their choice.” Ignoring the questionable syntax of the sentence, their conclusion is spot on. EHRs have traditionally been designed and marketed with a single customer in mind: providers. Although there are clear reasons to give patients better access to their medical data, EHR vendors have been content focusing on the provider market alone and leveraging information blocking approaches to prevent data from leaving their walled gardens. Prohibiting these anti-competitive practices is a no-brainer for spurring innovation. The new API requirement takes this goal further by prying open a second market for EHRs: consumers. Normally, you’d assume that it would be easy for the incumbent platforms to capture this new market as well. But the two markets require different priorities — whereas provider adoption is driven by enterprise sales and marketing,  consumer adoption will depend on a genuinely enjoyable user experience. Given the strong dissatisfaction with existing EHR systems among providers, I wouldn’t bet on these companies successfully commercializing a consumer-facing version. How EHRs will work in the future Instead, this leaves the door open for a wave of new health record apps that can pull data from APIs of existing EHRs while providing a consumer-first user experience. One product that fits the bill and is well-positioned to succeed is Apple Health Records . Health Records was initially designed to help patients aggregate medical data across care providers to have a centralized place of truth. Providers who opted into Health Records would go through a setup process to integrate their EHR vendor with Apple, and then patients would be able to find their provider within the Health app, log in with their credentials, and access their information. Before the new HHS rules, however, the market for Health Records was limited to providers who were already using EHRs that proactively published APIs. With the regulation changes, almost all providers will use EHRs with public APIs moving forward, making adoption of Health Records for providers and patients substantially easier. Write access APIs are a potential next step Despite these exciting potential avenues for innovation, the new HHS rules are restricted to requiring EHRs to publish read access APIs, but stay silent on write access APIs. Without write access, consumer EHR functionality will remain somewhat limited, serving as a more user-friendly visualization of health records without being able to manage them. Historically, most of healthcare has been “provider activated”,  in the sense that providers are the ones who prescribe treatments, record diagnoses, conduct procedures, and document updates on behalf of patients. In this world, it makes sense for providers to be the only users with write access to EHRs. However, the rise of digital health has spawned a brand new category of “patient activated” healthcare — patients can order anti-depressants or ED pills (think Roman, Hims), engage with well-being platforms (think Calm, Headspace), and track digital biomarkers (think Livongo, Apple Watch, Withings) without their primary care provider even knowing. Accounting for these applications, some form of EHR write access for patients becomes much more important. As an example, one of the main barriers to digital biomarkers being used in care decisions today is the fact that data captured by smart devices that you wear in the home may never reach your provider’s EHR. With write access APIs in the future, your provider would be able to seamlessly reference data on things like your weight, eating habits, sugar levels, or sleep quality when making care recommendations. The potential of write access APIs Consumer EHRs are a better source of truth One important issue we’ve yet to address is what happens to health data when care is fragmented among several providers. Despite its drawbacks, care fragmentation does not appear to be going away any time soon. Depending on where you look, you could even argue that the problem is getting worse — the widespread adoption of telemedicine has spawned virtual provider networks in addition to traditional ones, the retailization of healthcare may add thousands of new locations to receive medical services, and this is on top of patient activated services like well-being apps, digital pharmacies, and digital biomarkers. The third part of the new HHS rules, which requires hospitals to send electronic notifications to a patient’s other providers at critical junctures of care, isn’t enough to solve this problem. Care fragmentation can lead to a situation where the single source of truth for a patient’s health records isn’t clear anymore; instead, the information is scattered across multiple provider EHRs and is only complete when viewed in the aggregate. In this case, it becomes nearly impossible for each provider to keep all of a patient’s other providers up-to-date on new developments. Perhaps the answer requires a radical shift in thinking — de-prioritizing provider EHRs and instead making consumer EHRs the single source of truth. In this world, consumer EHRs would receive information largely in real-time from patient activated services like apps and biomarkers on one end. On the other end, they would communicate on-demand with provider EHRs before and after visits to stay in sync. If you were visiting a new provider for the first time, you would give consent to your consumer EHR to share your full health records with the provider. At the end of the visit, instead of entering updates to a provider EHR, the provider would write changes to your consumer EHR, which you would have in hand for all future visits, regardless of provider. Consumer EHRs as the single source of truth You might think that such a radical change would never happen in healthcare, and you might be right. But in any other industry, it wouldn’t just be radical — it would be obvious.', \"Welcome to the 2,121 newly Not Boring people who have joined us since last Monday!

On New Year’s Day, when there were only 309 people reading a newsletter called Per My Last E-mail, I wrote out some goals for the year. Obviously, a lot has changed since then. The place-based company I wanted to start is no longer, and I get to write Not Boring full-time. If this is all I did for a living and only 1,000 people subscribed, I’d be in trouble. But it still absolutely blows my mind that 25k of you read what I write, that companies are willing to pay me to tell you about their products, and that this is my job. I’m incredibly thankful to all of you. To celebrate, I decided to up the difficulty level a little bit this week. Anyone can make Stripe or the Metaverse sound exciting, but what about a company that we all love to hate, run by one of the least charismatic leaders in human history? Let’s get to it. Everybody Hates Facebook The Devil We Know Look, I don’t want to be writing this. You hate Facebook. I hate Facebook. Regulators hate Facebook. The only person who likes Facebook is that guy you went to high school with who posts Q Anon content and still wishes you happy birthday every year. Just look at the product. It’s a Frankenstein built from years of multivariate testing instead of product vision. Blurred to protect the identities of my friends who choose to post on FB. The reasons to hate Facebook are as numerous and fast-growing as their Daily Active Users. I’ve railed in this very newsletter about how wasteful it is that startups spend an estimated 30-40% of the money they raise on Facebook, Google, and Amazon ads. Zuck is not particularly lovable. The New Big Blue is where so much Fake News goes viral. Social media is addictive. Facebook just copies competitors’ best features. Facebook knows everything about us. The list goes on and on. But here we are, writing about the reasons to be bullish on Facebook, for the same reason that so many businesses turn to Facebook: we don’t have any other choice if we want to grow . After a euphoric 2020, anything that even smells like a growth stock is up dramatically. I just picked eight names off the top of my head: Peloton, Etsy, Shopify, Virgin Galactic, Tesla, Square, Spotify, Snap. The worst performing, Spotify, is up 128% YTD. Airbnb and DoorDash doubled their IPO price targets before they started trading. Even my beloved, beleaguered Slack got acquired. A lot of people invested in tech need to think about where to park their gains from the past year. Something safe, but with upside. Something that will benefit from the continued transfer from offline to online, but that likely won’t crash if multiples come back to earth. Something that will at least outpace inflation. Something with international exposure. Something that’s been held back by reasons only semi-related to the company’s performance. Something like… Facebook. Some of you might be thinking: “Duh yes, Facebook is one of the most valuable companies in the world. I watched The Social Network and The Social Dilemma , too. I know that Facebook is rolling into eCommerce. I’ve seen all of Mark Zuckerberg’s Congressional hearings. I come to Not Boring for new stuff, not boring companies like Facebook.” Aha! Because of that, I think that we might all be sleeping on Facebook a little bit. I know I have. So many of the things that we view as negative about Facebook are positives if you put on your investor hat and hold your nose. Monopolistic. While most acquisitions fail, Zuck and Sheryl have been so good at acquiring companies that the government is stepping in post-hoc to try to undo them. Tax on the Internet. That same “40% of all venture dollars raised” stat that’s rough for eCommerce businesses is great for Facebook. eCommerce needs Facebook to grow. WhatsApp Unmonetized. WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world, and Facebook has barely started monetizing it. My god… Zuck Has Too Much Power. If you think he’s an evil sociopath, that’s bad. But if you think he’s also a genius with a hard-to-grasp, long-term vision, that’s really good. Copycat. While it feels gross, it doesn’t really matter that Facebook copies from a business perspective. It owns distribution. Privacy Regulation. Paradoxically, the regulations meant to protect users from Facebook and Google just deepen Facebook and Google’s moats. This as much as anything is why I think regulators are stepping in to try to break up Facebook: all of the things that people dislike about Facebook are the same things that make it such an incredible business. Something just feels off about that. You know I love me a bearish narrative that I think might crack. While the stock hasn’t dragged quite like Slack pre-Salesforce, Spotify pre-Rogan, or Snap pre- 2020 Partner Summit , the fact is that Facebook feels kind of gross, so we just kind of ignore it, maybe buy a little, and focus on younger, fresher, sexier companies. But what they’re building is... actually kind of exciting. Put your shoes back on and hear me out! It’s going to take some explaining, which I’ll do: What is Facebook? There’s a lot going on. To understand everything that Facebook is planning, we need a good sense for what Facebook actually does today. Facebook’s Business Model. Zuck built what is arguably the world’s best business model, and he has the margins to prove it. Facebook’s Boring Stock Performance. While anything that even smells like eCommerce is exploding, Facebook, which collects a hefty tax on most eCommerce transactions, is underperforming the Nasdaq. That’s why we’re here today. Digital Real Estate. With the decreased importance of offline real estate, Facebook’s online real estate is some of the most valuable in the world. The Most Ambitious Backward Integration in History. Instead of just selling ads, Facebook is backward integrating into the transactions themselves. Facebook’s New Reality. Facebook is pushing heavily into AR, VR, and spatial computing in an attempt to control the next big computing platform. Putting it All Together. Facebook is an advertising juggernaut on pace to do more than $80 billion in revenue this year at 80+% gross margins, which has only become more critical for advertisers during the pandemic. Because it’s hated, you get all of that at a slight discount without accounting for Facebook’s wild bets on the future. Just to be extra clear: this is not a value judgement. Facebook may very well be evil. As I was writing this post, I hopped on to Twitter, and this is the first tweet that popped into my feed: But because we all think Facebook is evil, we don’t spend much time trying to understand the full scope of the business behind the products on which we spend 65 minutes per day. What is Facebook? Facebook is so omnipresent that the analysis of the company is all trees, no forest. When I started researching this piece, I realized that despite reading Stratechery daily and spending a lot of time on tech twitter, I don’t fully understand everything the company does and how it all fits together. So let’s all admit that we’ve lost track, hit reset, zoom out, and admire the forest. Nearly half of the world’s population uses one or more of Facebook’s four main social media properties - Facebook , Messenger , Instagram , and WhatsApp . Facebook is also building what it hopes is the next computing platform through Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Oculus, Portal, Spark AR, CTRL-labs, and more. The main Facebook product had 1.8 billion Daily Active Users (DAUs) and 2.7 billion Monthly Active Users in Q3 2020, while the “family” of products saw 2.5 billion Daily Active People (DAPs) and 3.2 billion Monthly Active People (MAPs) . They don’t report weekly figures, or what I’d assume they’d call “WAPs.” Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004 from his Harvard dorm room and IPO’d the company in May 2012 at a $104 billion market cap. The story is well-covered, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention one of my favorite quotes in recent cinematic history, from 2010’s The Social Network : “If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you’d have invented Facebook.” To build out its current Family of social products, Zuckerberg made three big moves: Acquired Instagram for a then-astonishing $1 billion in 2012, a month before IPO. (Read Sarah Frier’s excellent book, No Filter , for the full story.) Acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for an even-more-eye-popping $19 billion in 2014. Spun out Messenger from the core product in 2014. (Facebook also tried to acquire Snapchat in both 2013 and 2016, but CEO Evan Spiegel turned them down both times.) Facebook has used social acquisitions both offensively and defensively: Instagram. Investors’ biggest concern going into its IPO was its weakness on mobile. Facebook acquired the mobile-first Instagram to fill that gap (in addition to what Wharton Magazine called “the most epic tech pivot of the decade” to make Facebook itself a mobile product.) WhatsApp. Just as Facebook was making messaging a core service, WhatsApp was eating Messenger’s lunch in terms of engagement, and growing much faster. Snap. While the acquisition failed, the logic behind the attempt was clear. Facebook struggled to attract young users who were turned off by their moms’ presence. Snapchat is excellent at acquiring and retaining young users . Last week, the FTC and 46 states announced that they are suing Facebook to unwind the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions post-hoc, even after the FTC investigated and allowed the Instagram acquisition back in 2012. The FTC highlights emails in which Zuckerberg discusses “neutralizing potential competitors,” which sounds pretty anticompetitive, but they likely wouldn’t have brought the lawsuit if the acquisitions hadn’t been so darn successful. Instagram. The Acquired podcast called the Instagram acquisition the greatest acquisition of all time , reasoning that, at the $20 billion in 2019 revenue Bloomberg reported it did, the $1 billion acquisition is worth $153 billion of Facebook’s market cap . WhatsApp . WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world, and it’s not even close. WhatsApp has a reported 2 billion monthly active users , followed by Messenger with 1.3 billion, and Weixin/WeChat with 1.2 billion. All told, advertisers across the globe can reach nearly half of the world’s population via Facebook’s properties. Despite a massive base of 2.82 billion people, it grew MAPs 13.8% YoY. And that’s despite being banned in China, the world’s most populous country. If you remove China, Facebook reaches over half the world’s people. India is crucial to Facebook’s story: it has the most Facebook users (310 million) and most WhatsApp users (340 million) in the world, and Facebook recently invested $5.8 billion for 9.99% of Jio Platforms, Reliance’s telco which provides the 4G and 5G infrastructure powering India’s digital revolution. Back on the homefront, the company’s legal battle looms. I’m not an antitrust lawyer, so I have no idea whether the FTC’s attempt to break up Facebook will succeed. Prevailing wisdom seems to be that Facebook won’t be broken up, but that it will be limited in its ability to make future social acquisitions. That’s just fine. Facebook is in a pretty good spot with what it’s got. Facebook’s Business Model There are a lot of good business models on the internet, but Facebook’s might be the best of all. To understand why, it’s helpful to compare Facebook’s business with Google’s. Facebook makes money by aggregating consumer attention and data through its four main properties, and selling both to advertisers so that they can reach the right people with personalized ads. Like Google, Facebook generates the vast majority of its revenue (98.52% of its $70.7 billion in 2019 revenue) from selling ads. Facebook and Google are the only companies that Ben Thompson refers to as “ Super-Aggregators ”: This, then, is a super-aggregator: zero transaction costs not just in terms of user acquisition, but also supply acquisition, and most importantly, revenue acquisition, and Google and Facebook are the ultimate examples. In other words, Facebook has almost zero marginal costs -- they don’t pay to get me to use their products, I go there to see my friends’ content (which Facebook also doesn’t pay for), and advertisers self-serve through Facebook Business Suite without talking to an expensive sales person. While Google is intent-based -- I search for shoes and Google serves me ads for companies that make shoes -- Facebook is interest-based -- I am a 24-35-year-old male with feet who likes running, so companies that sell running shoes can reach me and others like me across Facebook’s properties (and on other sites via its Audience Network). Google can show me different variations of something I want, Facebook can show me products I didn’t even know I wanted. According to eMarketer, Facebook is slowly stealing market share from Google: Not only is Facebook growing faster than Google, it’s doing so at a much higher margin. Facebook’s numbers are astonishing. Revenue. $70.7 billion in 2019, grew 21.2% YoY in Q3. Gross Profit. $57.9 billion in 2019, good for an 81.9% gross margin . (Google’s is 55.6%) EBITDA. $34.6 billion in 2019, for a 48.9% EBITDA margin. Cash. $55.6 billion as of September 30, 2020, even after its $5.8 billion Jio investment. Users. 3.2 billion Monthly Active People across its apps worldwide. Despite its mind-blowing business model and the fact that Facebook is essentially a tax on eCommerce, its stock has remained relatively sleepy even as eCommerce penetration has doubled. Facebook’s Boring Stock Performance In Software is Eating the Markets , I wrote about the idea that because of new software products and increased access, retail investors are actually buying more than just a financial asset when they buy a stock; they’re buying social status, entertainment, education, and a digital asset that they can proudly display. Tesla is Exhibit A here. Owning Tesla gives you social status - its fans are a community, and its products ostensibly save the planet. Elon Musk is entertaining as hell (watch Elon debate Jack Ma ). Following Tesla (and by extension, SpaceX) is an education on the bleeding edge of technology. All of that means that Tesla bulls are proud to show off their Tesla shares as if they’re a digital asset with their own independent value. As a result… This can work both ways, though. Take Facebook. Owning the company has negative social status and is not a digital asset that most people would proudly display. We’re already bombarded with news about Facebook and all of the evil things it does, and spend over an hour on its properties every day, so investing in it is not that educational . And the company is a $700 billion-plus behemoth under attack from regulators; the stock doesn’t move wildly, it’s as blue chip as tech gets, which isn’t very entertaining . And have you ever watched Mark Zuckerberg speak? 😴 The Retail Investor Chart for Facebook looks something like this: Is anyone pumped to tell their friends they bought Facebook? I feel kinda embarrassed writing this whole thing, tbh. Add some antitrust hairiness into the mix, and you get this... The underperformance is more stark when you compare Facebook to its competitors across Social, FAAMG, and eCommerce. Here it is versus the social media companies Snap, Pinterest, and Twitter. To be sure, Pinterest and Snap grew much faster (off much smaller bases) than Facebook. While Facebook grew 21.2% YoY in Q3, Pinterest grew 58.2% (2.7x faster) and Snap grew 52.1% (2.5x faster). But their prices grew much faster than the relative revenue growth rates would suggest: Pinterest’s price is up 8.5x more than Facebook’s, and Snap’s is up 6.8x more. And then there’s Twitter, which actually grew revenue more slowly (at 13.7%) but has outperformed Facebook stock by 1.8x. So maybe it’s just that the market loves anything with a lower market cap because those stocks have more perceived upside (it doesn’t make sense, I know). If that’s the case, Facebook should fare better against the other FAAMG stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). Nope. Facebook is tied for the worst YTD performance among the FAAMG stocks with Google, at 33.3%, just slightly behind Microsoft (35.2%). Amazon and Apple have outperformed Facebook by more than 2x at 68.7% and 66.7% respectively. Facebook, though, sports the second-fastest YoY revenue and EPS growth behind Amazon, growing nearly twice as fast as Apple, Microsoft, and Google, and the highest gross margins and EBITDA margins of the bunch. We can do the same thing for eCommerce, where AMZN is the laggard at 68% YTD growth. Summarizing all of that in one, clean metric: Facebook trades at the lowest LTM and forward P/E multiples of any of the FAAMG, Social Media, or even eCommerce stock in its comp set. Like I said, people hate Facebook. But ‘tis the season, and anything even resembling value that has tech upside is a gift from Market Santa. Plus, holiday shopping might break the floodgates. Facebook owns the most valuable digital real estate in the world during the time when digital real estate is more important than it’s ever been. The Importance of Digital Real Estate In the Social Capital 2018 Annual Letter , Chamath Palihapitiya wrote: “Startups spend almost 40 cents of every VC dollar on Google, Facebook, and Amazon.” I’ve written about this many times, but only from the perspective of the startups doing the spending. From Facebook’s perspective, taking its share of 40% of the money startups raise is a fantastic thing. And Chamath wrote that back when many startups had the option to spend on retail distribution… In order to counteract Facebook, Google, and Amazon’s power and decrease customer acquisition costs (CACs), many DTC companies came offline, into physical retail. Physical presence gives brands the opportunity to acquire customers who happen to be walking by. What they lose in margin from paying rent and employing store associates, the idea goes, they make up in lower CACs. Warby Parker kicked off the trend a few years ago by launching their own brick and mortar stores, and other DTC darlings like Bonobos, Casper, and Everlane followed suit. A 2018 JLL report projected that digitally native brands would open 850 retail locations in the next five years. Countless more added retail to their channel mix by selling through Walmart, Target, and other big box stores. COVID stopped that trend in its tracks. Not only did it push digitally native brands back to online-only, it forced offline businesses to move online in earnest for the first time. eCommerce platforms’ share prices have skyrocketed during COVID as a result. Amazon is the only one in this basket of eCommerce leaders that hasn’t more than doubled, and it’s up 68% off a market cap that was just under $1 trillion coming into the year. And it’s about to get really crazy. The fourth quarter is traditionally the strongest time of the year for retailers and eCommerce companies because of holiday shopping. This is what Black Friday used to look like: This year, most of that chaos moved online. Shopify saw a 76% increase in Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales from $2.9 billion in 2019 to $5.1 billion in 2020, while independent sellers on Amazon increased sales 60% to $4.8 billion . It makes sense that eCommerce platforms’ shares would rally. That’s where shopping gets done today. But Facebook should be a major beneficiary too, because brick and mortar wasn’t just where the sale happened, it’s where discovery happened as well. Now, both digitally native and traditional retailers are being forced to acquire customers online, creating marginal demand for Facebook’s product and driving up CPMs across the board. I spoke to two people who confirmed my hunch: An eCommerce company told me they were seeing higher CACs than ever before because of increased competition from offline retailers, but that they were spending anyway, because they needed to hit holiday targets and were still seeing a positive return on their Facebook ad spend. A venture capitalist told me their portfolio companies, large private companies in the US and abroad, were setting records for Facebook spend recently. With physical real estate’s decreased importance, digital real estate is more important than ever. And no other digital platform can reliably deliver the same returns for advertisers that Facebook can across its Facebook and Instagram properties (although some companies outperform in specific channels). That position is starting to show up in the numbers. In July, Facebook guided to 10% YoY revenue growth in Q3. Thanks to an unexpectedly strong August and September, it grew 21% YoY, blowing out its own expectations. While it didn’t give specific guidance for Q4, CFO Dave Wehnher said on the earnings call that the company expects Q4 growth to be higher than the Q3 growth rate. I think it’s going to report eye-popping Q4 numbers. Today, ten million businesses advertise on Facebook across the globe. If they consolidate all of their spend online over the holiday season, it will provide a short-term spark to Facebook’s stock. But it’s Facebook’s backward integration directly into commerce that gets me most excited. The Most Ambitious Backward Integration in History What Facebook is trying to pull off is unprecedented: it’s a $780 billion company that generates 98.5% of its revenue from a high-margin ads business backward integrating into eCommerce. Ads won’t just be top-of-funnel, they will be the funnel. Facebook does more for businesses than just allow its ten million advertisers to target customers with personalized advertising. It also gives 200 million businesses a suite of free tools to reach, communicate with, and now, sell to customers. To hear Zuck and Sandberg talk about it, it almost sounds like Stripe without the Irish brogue -- they, too, want to increase the GDP of the internet by empowering small businesses. While Stripe benefits from a growing internet in the form of transaction fees, Facebook benefits from more demand for ads. Increasingly, Facebook is backward integrating from simply being an advertising platform into building the tools to facilitate customer communication and commerce in-app. Just like Tencent built tools for businesses in WeChat after seeing businesses communicating with customers in the app, Facebook saw businesses in Thailand use profiles on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger as their homepages and leaned in by adding features. They built catalogs, then a Marketplace Tab, then power tools. Now, Facebook powers roughly 1% of Thailand’s GDP (~$5 billion in GMV), and Facebook is rolling out the tools that it built there in the US and around the globe. Over the past year, Facebook has undertaken two related projects to unify the Family of products and help businesses sell through them: Messaging Interoperability and Shops . Messaging Interoperability. Facebook is in the middle of a large infrastructure project that will allow people to send messages to each other from their Facebook messaging product of choice -- Messenger, Instagram Direct, or WhatsApp. If I spend all of my time on Instagram, but my mom uses WhatsApp, I’ll be able to send a message from my Instagram Direct to her WhatsApp, and vice versa. In September, Facebook released the first leg of the project: cross-platform messaging between Messenger and Instagram . Interoperability has two main benefits for Facebook. First, it strengthens its network effect by increasing the utility for any user if their friends use any of the three Facebook messaging products. Second, it allows businesses to communicate with customers wherever they prefer. Facebook’s new Business Suite, which it also rolled out in September, features one inbox for customer messages from Instagram Direct and Messenger and comments on Facebook and Instagram posts. Communication is the easiest path online. It’s easier than building a website and accepting payments, even with Shopify and Stripe. If Facebook’s Business Suite and improved messaging capabilities allow more businesses to sell online, it will create more potential ads customers and maybe more businesses willing to pay for Facebook to run the lightweight backend of their business. Shops. In May, Facebook announced the launch of Shops on Facebook and Instagram. Shops let businesses set up free storefronts on their Facebook or Instagram profiles, powered by one backend. From the Facebook or Instagram stores, customers can either click through to buy on the businesses’ websites, or buy directly in-Shop via Checkout . Instead of building all of the eCommerce infrastructure itself, Facebook is partnering with any eCommerce platform not named “Amazon.” When Zuckerberg announced the product in May, he invited Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke to the stream. That highlights Shopify’s relative importance, but it is not, as originally reported, Facebook’s exclusive partner. Understanding the relationship between the two companies in light of Facebook Shops is a whole ‘nother post, but it’s interesting that Shopify is acting like an API-first company for Facebook here. Shops does a couple of things for Facebook. First, it should help increase conversion by removing friction, which will ultimately make businesses want to buy more ads . Second, Facebook will make money from a small transaction fee via Checkout. Over time, Messaging Interoperability and Shops will continue to converge. On the Q3 earnings call, Zuckerberg said that the goal is to build a commerce platform around messaging, starting with bringing Shops to WhatsApp and Messenger, and by building tools that let businesses follow up with customers, complete transactions, and accept payments. In a first step towards monetizing that vision in the US, Facebook began testing a new ad product, click-to-messaging, through which businesses can generate conversations with customers. That ad product, and the increased focus on commerce through messaging, helps explain Facebook’s late-November $1 billion acquisition of Kustomer (talk about a high Kustomer acquisition cost!). Kustomer is a control center for conversations that take place across channels -- from text, to email, to social media -- which fits nicely with Facebook’s goal of unifying messaging, and also uses AI to handle simple requests, which should allow businesses to deal with increased conversation volume generated by click-to-messaging ads. Just last week, Facebook rolled out more features to improve messaging-based and in-app commerce. Last Wednesday, it added carts to WhatsApp , and on Friday, it added shopping to Reels , its TikTok clone. These solutions are still clunky. In the US, for example, WhatsApp carts don’t support payments, so businesses and customers need to arrange payments separately. But Facebook recently rolled out WhatsApp payments in India, where it is the country’s SuperApp, after years of government pushback. Facebook’s $5.8 billion investment in Reliance’s Jio Platforms likely helped grease the wheels. As with Marketplace in Thailand, as Facebook works out the kinks in India, it will roll out messaging-based payments to its 3.2 billion MAPs around the globe as it slowly convinces governments it can be trusted with our money. As it continues to connect its various platforms and integrate more commerce and payments functionality, Facebook will complete the most ambitious backward integration in history, from ads into eCommerce. It will own the funnel. To be sure, all of this is early and unproven, and Facebook isn’t exactly known for its product innovation. For a unification project, it all feels a bit piecemeal. Plus, the company has also faced headwinds in markets around the globe, where governments are slow to trust Facebook to handle payments. But it points to how Facebook is thinking about unifying its products to help businesses not only reach, but communicate with and sell directly to, new and existing customers, wherever they happen to be. To that end, it’s not hard to imagine that Facebook might even roll out Shops and messaging functionality through its mobile app ad network, Facebook Audience Network . The implications of that would be enormous. It would mean businesses will be able to set up … shop … anywhere they’re able to place ads today. Imagine checking out directly in ads across the internet; see, click, buy, or talk to a person (or AI) to answer any questions. If Facebook pulls off that vision, it will have its own Everywhere Store to battle Amazon’s Everything Store . Oh yeah, and one more thing… Facebook’s Next Reality Everything that Facebook has achieved on mobile is made more impressive by the fact that Facebook almost missed the platform altogether. It was a desktop-first product when it went public, and the market didn’t believe it could make the transition to mobile. The app was janky and built on HTML5 (RIP), and analysts feared that a mobile NewsFeed couldn’t support an ad load. Its shares fell from $42 to $19 in Facebook’s first three months as a public company. Zuck fixed the mobile problem by acquiring Instagram and pushing the company into a hard pivot, but it was harrowing, and he vowed to not miss the next one. To that end, Facebook made two acquisitions that are particularly intriguing: Oculus. Acquired the maker of VR headsets for $2.3 billion in 2014. CTRL-labs. In a less splashy move, acquired the brain-computing startup for between $500 million and $1 billion in 2019. As of August, Facebook rolled Oculus, CTRL-labs, Portal, and Snap Lens Studio lookalike Spark AR into Facebook Reality Labs . The division, reporting to Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth, is responsible for Facebook’s efforts in VR, AR, and the spatial computing operating system. With its hands tied on social and messaging acquisitions, eight of its last ten acquisitions have been under Facebook Reality Labs. It’s easy to dismiss the effort -- who wants Facebook controlling the Metaverse? -- but it’s showing potential. Portal. After a chilly reception that went something like “no fucking way am I letting Zuck into my house,” Portal sales have taken off during the pandemic. My sister lives in Ghana, and she and my mom talk over Portal every day. When we’re all physically distanced, the Portal can make people feel closer together. Oculus. Facebook lowered the price point for the Oculus Quest 2, it’s newest VR headset, to $299, and pre-orders surpassed the original Oculus’ by 5x. Oculus Quest 2 is the best standalone headset on the market, and is likely to be the best-selling of all-time. Spark AR. While this is a painfully blatant rip off of Snap, the same logic I used for Snap holds here: by putting lightweight AR in hundreds of millions of peoples’ hands, Facebook is getting an early headstart on building Mirrorworld. AR Glasses. Facebook has plans to release AR glasses next year, in partnership with Luxottica. Early attempts to build AR glasses -- from Google Glass to Snap Lenses -- have ranged from butt-of-joke to toy-like, but if Facebook can marry what’s worked in Oculus with the lighter touch needed for AR, it has a shot. Just like Facebook’s social apps, the Facebook Reality Labs products will work together, in this case to try to usher in the era of spatial computing on Zuck’s terms. To become the platform, Zuck predicts the company needs to sell 10 million Oculus headsets in order to attract enough developers to build an ecosystem. That’s why the company dropped its price to $299. The prize couldn’t be bigger: if Facebook becomes the default platform for VR, AR, or both, it will hold the position that Apple and Google hold in mobile today. Plus, it will be able to plug in its social, messaging, and commerce features to the new platform from day one, creating new opportunities for businesses, and of course, for Facebook itself. Is Facebook owning a foundational Metaverse platform a good thing? Probably not. Over the past two weeks, I finally read Ernest Cline’s 2012 Metaverse instant classic, Ready Player One , and his new sequel, Ready Player Two , so I’m on high-alert. If the real thing turns out to be anything like the books’ fictional OASIS, the decisions that the platform owner makes will have an unprecedented impact on billions of lives. Ready Player One takes place in a VR world powered by an advanced Oculus Quest-like headset. Ready Player Two raises the stakes when it moves players from VR headsets to ONI, a non-invasive neural interface through which players can control their avatars and experience others’ lives just by thinking. Facebook has its own answer to ONI in CTRL-labs, which brings great promise and great danger, and will need to be regulated appropriately if it comes to market. Dystopian visions aside, in both fiction and, I suspect, reality, the company that owns the Metaverse will be the most valuable in the world. We’re many years away, and I prefer Tencent and Epic’s more decentralized approach , but Facebook is a contender, and you get that upside potential for free. Putting it All Together Facebook is hard to love. Concerns around privacy and anticompetitive behavior abound, it rips off other companies’ product work, and I’m not convinced Mark Zuckerberg isn’t a robot. But as Ben Graham told a young Warren Buffett, “In the short run, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long run, it’s a weighing machine.” Facebook will do more than $80 billion in revenue with gross margins over 80% and EBITDA margins over 40%. Half of the people in the world outside of China use its products. It’s built arguably the best business model in the world. It stands to benefit as much as anyone this side of Seattle from the dramatic and sudden shift to eCommerce. But despite that, it’s trading at the lowest P/E multiple among FAAMG, eCommerce, and social media companies. There are obvious headwinds. We’ve discussed many in the piece, including an active antitrust lawsuit, and we haven’t even mentioned two of the strongest: Apple’s IDFA update in iOS 14 which will hurt Facebook’s ability to collect data and target customers in apps. TikTok may steal attention, the lifeblood of an Aggregator, from Facebook, or at the very least, hamper its ability to acquire young users. But Facebook is undervalued relative to any set of peers, and that’s before taking its bets on the future into consideration. In the near-term, it is unifying messaging, social, and commerce in the most ambitious backward integration in history. Long-term, it may become the platform on which the Virtual Reality economy is built. And we got through this without mentioning Facebook’s crypto project (currently: Diem ) 😏\\xa0 or its Giphy acquisition . I love finding an overblown bearish narrative. Normally, I disagree with its sentiment. In this case, I agree -- Facebook feels icky -- but in this market , I’m not letting a little ick get in the way of a good value. Thanks to Dan and Puja for editing! You’re both the Sheryl to my Zuck. Full Disclosure: I own shares in Facebook which make up less than 2% of my portfolio.

On New Year’s Day, when there were only 309 people reading a newsletter called Per My Last E-mail, I wrote out some goals for the year. Obviously, a lot has changed since then. The place-based company I wanted to start is no longer, and I get to write Not Boring full-time. If this is all I did for a living and only 1,000 people subscribed, I’d be in trouble. But it still absolutely blows my mind that 25k of you read what I write, that companies are willing to pay me to tell you about their products, and that this is my job. I’m incredibly thankful to all of you. To celebrate, I decided to up the difficulty level a little bit this week. Anyone can make Stripe or the Metaverse sound exciting, but what about a company that we all love to hate, run by one of the least charismatic leaders in human history? Let’s find out. Throw on The Social Network soundtrack… … and let’s get to it. Everybody Hates Facebook The Devil We Know Look, I don’t want to be writing this. You hate Facebook. I hate Facebook. Regulators hate Facebook. The only person who likes Facebook is that guy you went to high school with who posts Q Anon content and still wishes you happy birthday every year. Just look at the product. It’s a Frankenstein built from years of multivariate testing instead of product vision. Blurred to protect the identities of my friends who choose to post on FB. The reasons to hate Facebook are as numerous and fast-growing as their Daily Active Users. I’ve railed in this very newsletter about how wasteful it is that startups spend an estimated 30-40% of the money they raise on Facebook, Google, and Amazon ads. Zuck is not particularly lovable. The New Big Blue is where so much Fake News goes viral. Social media is addictive. Facebook just copies competitors’ best features. Facebook knows everything about us. The list goes on and on. But here we are, writing about the reasons to be bullish on Facebook, for the same reason that so many businesses turn to Facebook: we don’t have any other choice if we want to grow . After a euphoric 2020, anything that even smells like a growth stock is up dramatically. I just picked eight names off the top of my head: Peloton, Etsy, Shopify, Virgin Galactic, Tesla, Square, Spotify, Snap. The worst performing, Spotify, is up 128% YTD. Airbnb and DoorDash doubled their IPO price targets before they started trading. Even my beloved, beleaguered Slack got acquired. A lot of people invested in tech need to think about where to park their gains from the past year. Something safe, but with upside. Something that will benefit from the continued transfer from offline to online, but that likely won’t crash if multiples come back to earth. Something that will at least outpace inflation. Something with international exposure. Something that’s been held back by reasons only semi-related to the company’s performance. Something like… Facebook. Some of you might be thinking: “Duh yes, Facebook is one of the most valuable companies in the world. I watched The Social Network and The Social Dilemma , too. I know that Facebook is rolling into eCommerce. I’ve seen all of Mark Zuckerberg’s Congressional hearings. I come to Not Boring for new stuff, not boring companies like Facebook.” Aha! Because of that, I think that we might all be sleeping on Facebook a little bit. I know I have. So many of the things that we view as negative about Facebook are positives if you put on your investor hat and hold your nose. Monopolistic. While most acquisitions fail, Zuck and Sheryl have been so good at acquiring companies that the government is stepping in post-hoc to try to undo them. Tax on the Internet. That same “40% of all venture dollars raised” stat that’s rough for eCommerce businesses is great for Facebook. eCommerce needs Facebook to grow. WhatsApp Unmonetized. WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world, and Facebook has barely started monetizing it. My god… Zuck Has Too Much Power. If you think he’s an evil sociopath, that’s bad. But if you think he’s also a genius with a hard-to-grasp, long-term vision, that’s really good. Copycat. While it feels gross, it doesn’t really matter that Facebook copies from a business perspective. It owns distribution. Privacy Regulation. Paradoxically, the regulations meant to protect users from Facebook and Google just deepen Facebook and Google’s moats. This as much as anything is why I think regulators are stepping in to try to break up Facebook: all of the things that people dislike about Facebook are the same things that make it such an incredible business. Something just feels off about that. You know I love me a bearish narrative that I think might crack. While the stock hasn’t dragged quite like Slack pre-Salesforce, Spotify pre-Rogan, or Snap pre- 2020 Partner Summit , the fact is that Facebook feels kind of gross, so we just kind of ignore it, maybe buy a little, and focus on younger, fresher, sexier companies. But what they’re building is... actually kind of exciting. Put your shoes back on and hear me out! It’s going to take some explaining, which I’ll do: What is Facebook? There’s a lot going on. To understand everything that Facebook is planning, we need a good sense for what Facebook actually does today. Facebook’s Business Model. Zuck built what is arguably the world’s best business model, and he has the margins to prove it. Facebook’s Boring Stock Performance. While anything that even smells like eCommerce is exploding, Facebook, which collects a hefty tax on most eCommerce transactions, is underperforming the Nasdaq. That’s why we’re here today. Digital Real Estate. With the decreased importance of offline real estate, Facebook’s online real estate is some of the most valuable in the world. The Most Ambitious Backward Integration in History. Instead of just selling ads, Facebook is backward integrating into the transactions themselves. Facebook’s New Reality. Facebook is pushing heavily into AR, VR, and spatial computing in an attempt to control the next big computing platform. Putting it All Together. Facebook is an advertising juggernaut on pace to do more than $80 billion in revenue this year at 80+% gross margins, which has only become more critical for advertisers during the pandemic. Because it’s hated, you get all of that at a slight discount without accounting for Facebook’s wild bets on the future. Just to be extra clear: this is not a value judgement. Facebook may very well be evil. As I was writing this post, I hopped on to Twitter, and this is the first tweet that popped into my feed: But because we all think Facebook is evil, we don’t spend much time trying to understand the full scope of the business behind the products on which we spend 65 minutes per day. What is Facebook? Facebook is so omnipresent that the analysis of the company is all trees, no forest. When I started researching this piece, I realized that despite reading Stratechery daily and spending a lot of time on tech twitter, I don’t fully understand everything the company does and how it all fits together. So let’s all admit that we’ve lost track, hit reset, zoom out, and admire the forest. Nearly half of the world’s population uses one or more of Facebook’s four main social media properties - Facebook , Messenger , Instagram , and WhatsApp . Facebook is also building what it hopes is the next computing platform through Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Oculus, Portal, Spark AR, CTRL-labs, and more. The main Facebook product had 1.8 billion Daily Active Users (DAUs) and 2.7 billion Monthly Active Users in Q3 2020, while the “family” of products saw 2.5 billion Daily Active People (DAPs) and 3.2 billion Monthly Active People (MAPs) . They don’t report weekly figures, or what I’d assume they’d call “WAPs.” Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004 from his Harvard dorm room and IPO’d the company in May 2012 at a $104 billion market cap. The story is well-covered, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention one of my favorite quotes in recent cinematic history, from 2010’s The Social Network : “If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you’d have invented Facebook.” To build out its current Family of social products, Zuckerberg made three big moves: Acquired Instagram for a then-astonishing $1 billion in 2012, a month before IPO. (Read Sarah Frier’s excellent book, No Filter , for the full story.) Acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for an even-more-eye-popping $19 billion in 2014. Spun out Messenger from the core product in 2014. (Facebook also tried to acquire Snapchat in both 2013 and 2016, but CEO Evan Spiegel turned them down both times.) Facebook has used social acquisitions both offensively and defensively: Instagram. Investors’ biggest concern going into its IPO was its weakness on mobile. Facebook acquired the mobile-first Instagram to fill that gap (in addition to what Wharton Magazine called “the most epic tech pivot of the decade” to make Facebook itself a mobile product.) WhatsApp. Just as Facebook was making messaging a core service, WhatsApp was eating Messenger’s lunch in terms of engagement, and growing much faster. Snap. While the acquisition failed, the logic behind the attempt was clear. Facebook struggled to attract young users who were turned off by their moms’ presence. Snapchat is excellent at acquiring and retaining young users . Last week, the FTC and 46 states announced that they are suing Facebook to unwind the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions post-hoc, even after the FTC investigated and allowed the Instagram acquisition back in 2012. The FTC highlights emails in which Zuckerberg discusses “neutralizing potential competitors,” which sounds pretty anticompetitive, but they likely wouldn’t have brought the lawsuit if the acquisitions hadn’t been so darn successful. Instagram. The Acquired podcast called the Instagram acquisition the greatest acquisition of all time , reasoning that, at the $20 billion in 2019 revenue Bloomberg reported it did, the $1 billion acquisition is worth $153 billion of Facebook’s market cap . WhatsApp . WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world, and it’s not even close. WhatsApp has a reported 2 billion monthly active users , followed by Messenger with 1.3 billion, and Weixin/WeChat with 1.2 billion. All told, advertisers across the globe can reach nearly half of the world’s population via Facebook’s properties. Despite a massive base of 2.82 billion people, it grew MAPs 13.8% YoY. And that’s despite being banned in China, the world’s most populous country. If you remove China, Facebook reaches over half the world’s people. India is crucial to Facebook’s story: it has the most Facebook users (310 million) and most WhatsApp users (340 million) in the world, and Facebook recently invested $5.8 billion for 9.99% of Jio Platforms, Reliance’s telco which provides the 4G and 5G infrastructure powering India’s digital revolution. Back on the homefront, the company’s legal battle looms. I’m not an antitrust lawyer, so I have no idea whether the FTC’s attempt to break up Facebook will succeed. Prevailing wisdom seems to be that Facebook won’t be broken up, but that it will be limited in its ability to make future social acquisitions. That’s just fine. Facebook is in a pretty good spot with what it’s got. Facebook’s Business Model There are a lot of good business models on the internet, but Facebook’s might be the best of all. To understand why, it’s helpful to compare Facebook’s business with Google’s. Facebook makes money by aggregating consumer attention and data through its four main properties, and selling both to advertisers so that they can reach the right people with personalized ads. Like Google, Facebook generates the vast majority of its revenue (98.52% of its $70.7 billion in 2019 revenue) from selling ads. Facebook and Google are the only companies that Ben Thompson refers to as “ Super-Aggregators ”: This, then, is a super-aggregator: zero transaction costs not just in terms of user acquisition, but also supply acquisition, and most importantly, revenue acquisition, and Google and Facebook are the ultimate examples. In other words, Facebook has almost zero marginal costs -- they don’t pay to get me to use their products, I go there to see my friends’ content (which Facebook also doesn’t pay for), and advertisers self-serve through Facebook Business Suite without talking to an expensive sales person. While Google is intent-based -- I search for shoes and Google serves me ads for companies that make shoes -- Facebook is interest-based -- I am a 24-35-year-old male with feet who likes running, so companies that sell running shoes can reach me and others like me across Facebook’s properties (and on other sites via its Audience Network). Google can show me different variations of something I want, Facebook can show me products I didn’t even know I wanted. According to eMarketer, Facebook is slowly stealing market share from Google: Not only is Facebook growing faster than Google, it’s doing so at a much higher margin. Facebook’s numbers are astonishing. Revenue. $70.7 billion in 2019, grew 21.2% YoY in Q3. Gross Profit. $57.9 billion in 2019, good for an 81.9% gross margin . (Google’s is 55.6%) EBITDA. $34.6 billion in 2019, for a 48.9% EBITDA margin. Cash. $55.6 billion as of September 30, 2020, even after its $5.8 billion Jio investment. Users. 3.2 billion Monthly Active People across its apps worldwide. Despite its mind-blowing business model and the fact that Facebook is essentially a tax on eCommerce, its stock has remained relatively sleepy even as eCommerce penetration has doubled. Facebook’s Boring Stock Performance In Software is Eating the Markets , I wrote about the idea that because of new software products and increased access, retail investors are actually buying more than just a financial asset when they buy a stock; they’re buying social status, entertainment, education, and a digital asset that they can proudly display. Tesla is Exhibit A here. Owning Tesla gives you social status - its fans are a community, and its products ostensibly save the planet. Elon Musk is entertaining as hell (watch Elon debate Jack Ma ). Following Tesla (and by extension, SpaceX) is an education on the bleeding edge of technology. All of that means that Tesla bulls are proud to show off their Tesla shares as if they’re a digital asset with their own independent value. As a result… This can work both ways, though. Take Facebook. Owning the company has negative social status and is not a digital asset that most people would proudly display. We’re already bombarded with news about Facebook and all of the evil things it does, and spend over an hour on its properties every day, so investing in it is not that educational . And the company is a $700 billion-plus behemoth under attack from regulators; the stock doesn’t move wildly, it’s as blue chip as tech gets, which isn’t very entertaining . And have you ever watched Mark Zuckerberg speak? 😴 The Retail Investor Chart for Facebook looks something like this: Is anyone pumped to tell their friends they bought Facebook? I feel kinda embarrassed writing this whole thing, tbh. Add some antitrust hairiness into the mix, and you get this... The underperformance is more stark when you compare Facebook to its competitors across Social, FAAMG, and eCommerce. Here it is versus the social media companies Snap, Pinterest, and Twitter. To be sure, Pinterest and Snap grew much faster (off much smaller bases) than Facebook. While Facebook grew 21.2% YoY in Q3, Pinterest grew 58.2% (2.7x faster) and Snap grew 52.1% (2.5x faster). But their prices grew much faster than the relative revenue growth rates would suggest: Pinterest’s price is up 8.5x more than Facebook’s, and Snap’s is up 6.8x more. And then there’s Twitter, which actually grew revenue more slowly (at 13.7%) but has outperformed Facebook stock by 1.8x. So maybe it’s just that the market loves anything with a lower market cap because those stocks have more perceived upside (it doesn’t make sense, I know). If that’s the case, Facebook should fare better against the other FAAMG stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). Nope. Facebook is tied for the worst YTD performance among the FAAMG stocks with Google, at 33.3%, just slightly behind Microsoft (35.2%). Amazon and Apple have outperformed Facebook by more than 2x at 68.7% and 66.7% respectively. Facebook, though, sports the second-fastest YoY revenue and EPS growth behind Amazon, growing nearly twice as fast as Apple, Microsoft, and Google, and the highest gross margins and EBITDA margins of the bunch. We can do the same thing for eCommerce, where AMZN is the laggard at 68% YTD growth. Summarizing all of that in one, clean metric: Facebook trades at the lowest LTM and forward P/E multiples of any of the FAAMG, Social Media, or even eCommerce stock in its comp set. Like I said, people hate Facebook. But ‘tis the season, and anything even resembling value that has tech upside is a gift from Market Santa. Plus, holiday shopping might break the floodgates. Facebook owns the most valuable digital real estate in the world during the time when digital real estate is more important than it’s ever been. The Importance of Digital Real Estate In the Social Capital 2018 Annual Letter , Chamath Palihapitiya wrote: “Startups spend almost 40 cents of every VC dollar on Google, Facebook, and Amazon.” I’ve written about this many times, but only from the perspective of the startups doing the spending. From Facebook’s perspective, taking its share of 40% of the money startups raise is a fantastic thing. And Chamath wrote that back when many startups had the option to spend on retail distribution… In order to counteract Facebook, Google, and Amazon’s power and decrease customer acquisition costs (CACs), many DTC companies came offline, into physical retail. Physical presence gives brands the opportunity to acquire customers who happen to be walking by. What they lose in margin from paying rent and employing store associates, the idea goes, they make up in lower CACs. Warby Parker kicked off the trend a few years ago by launching their own brick and mortar stores, and other DTC darlings like Bonobos, Casper, and Everlane followed suit. A 2018 JLL report projected that digitally native brands would open 850 retail locations in the next five years. Countless more added retail to their channel mix by selling through Walmart, Target, and other big box stores. COVID stopped that trend in its tracks. Not only did it push digitally native brands back to online-only, it forced offline businesses to move online in earnest for the first time. eCommerce platforms’ share prices have skyrocketed during COVID as a result. Amazon is the only one in this basket of eCommerce leaders that hasn’t more than doubled, and it’s up 68% off a market cap that was just under $1 trillion coming into the year. And it’s about to get really crazy. The fourth quarter is traditionally the strongest time of the year for retailers and eCommerce companies because of holiday shopping. This is what Black Friday used to look like: This year, most of that chaos moved online. Shopify saw a 76% increase in Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales from $2.9 billion in 2019 to $5.1 billion in 2020, while independent sellers on Amazon increased sales 60% to $4.8 billion . It makes sense that eCommerce platforms’ shares would rally. That’s where shopping gets done today. But Facebook should be a major beneficiary too, because brick and mortar wasn’t just where the sale happened, it’s where discovery happened as well. Now, both digitally native and traditional retailers are being forced to acquire customers online, creating marginal demand for Facebook’s product and driving up CPMs across the board. I spoke to two people who confirmed my hunch: An eCommerce company told me they were seeing higher CACs than ever before because of increased competition from offline retailers, but that they were spending anyway, because they needed to hit holiday targets and were still seeing a positive return on their Facebook ad spend. A venture capitalist told me their portfolio companies, large private companies in the US and abroad, were setting records for Facebook spend recently. With physical real estate’s decreased importance, digital real estate is more important than ever. And no other digital platform can reliably deliver the same returns for advertisers that Facebook can across its Facebook and Instagram properties (although some companies outperform in specific channels). That position is starting to show up in the numbers. In July, Facebook guided to 10% YoY revenue growth in Q3. Thanks to an unexpectedly strong August and September, it grew 21% YoY, blowing out its own expectations. While it didn’t give specific guidance for Q4, CFO Dave Wehnher said on the earnings call that the company expects Q4 growth to be higher than the Q3 growth rate. I think it’s going to report eye-popping Q4 numbers. Today, ten million businesses advertise on Facebook across the globe. If they consolidate all of their spend online over the holiday season, it will provide a short-term spark to Facebook’s stock. But it’s Facebook’s backward integration directly into commerce that gets me most excited. The Most Ambitious Backward Integration in History What Facebook is trying to pull off is unprecedented: it’s a $780 billion company that generates 98.5% of its revenue from a high-margin ads business backward integrating into eCommerce. Ads won’t just be top-of-funnel, they will be the funnel. Facebook does more for businesses than just allow its ten million advertisers to target customers with personalized advertising. It also gives 200 million businesses a suite of free tools to reach, communicate with, and now, sell to customers. To hear Zuck and Sandberg talk about it, it almost sounds like Stripe without the Irish brogue -- they, too, want to increase the GDP of the internet by empowering small businesses. While Stripe benefits from a growing internet in the form of transaction fees, Facebook benefits from more demand for ads. Increasingly, Facebook is backward integrating from simply being an advertising platform into building the tools to facilitate customer communication and commerce in-app. Just like Tencent built tools for businesses in WeChat after seeing businesses communicating with customers in the app, Facebook saw businesses in Thailand use profiles on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger as their homepages and leaned in by adding features. They built catalogs, then a Marketplace Tab, then power tools. Now, Facebook powers roughly 1% of Thailand’s GDP (~$5 billion in GMV), and Facebook is rolling out the tools that it built there in the US and around the globe. Over the past year, Facebook has undertaken two related projects to unify the Family of products and help businesses sell through them: Messaging Interoperability and Shops . Messaging Interoperability. Facebook is in the middle of a large infrastructure project that will allow people to send messages to each other from their Facebook messaging product of choice -- Messenger, Instagram Direct, or WhatsApp. If I spend all of my time on Instagram, but my mom uses WhatsApp, I’ll be able to send a message from my Instagram Direct to her WhatsApp, and vice versa. In September, Facebook released the first leg of the project: cross-platform messaging between Messenger and Instagram . Interoperability has two main benefits for Facebook. First, it strengthens its network effect by increasing the utility for any user if their friends use any of the three Facebook messaging products. Second, it allows businesses to communicate with customers wherever they prefer. Facebook’s new Business Suite, which it also rolled out in September, features one inbox for customer messages from Instagram Direct and Messenger and comments on Facebook and Instagram posts. Communication is the easiest path online. It’s easier than building a website and accepting payments, even with Shopify and Stripe. If Facebook’s Business Suite and improved messaging capabilities allow more businesses to sell online, it will create more potential ads customers and maybe more businesses willing to pay for Facebook to run the lightweight backend of their business. Shops. In May, Facebook announced the launch of Shops on Facebook and Instagram. Shops let businesses set up free storefronts on their Facebook or Instagram profiles, powered by one backend. From the Facebook or Instagram stores, customers can either click through to buy on the businesses’ websites, or buy directly in-Shop via Checkout . Instead of building all of the eCommerce infrastructure itself, Facebook is partnering with any eCommerce platform not named “Amazon.” When Zuckerberg announced the product in May, he invited Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke to the stream. That highlights Shopify’s relative importance, but it is not, as originally reported, Facebook’s exclusive partner. Understanding the relationship between the two companies in light of Facebook Shops is a whole ‘nother post, but it’s interesting that Shopify is acting like an API-first company for Facebook here. Shops does a couple of things for Facebook. First, it should help increase conversion by removing friction, which will ultimately make businesses want to buy more ads . Second, Facebook will make money from a small transaction fee via Checkout. Over time, Messaging Interoperability and Shops will continue to converge. On the Q3 earnings call, Zuckerberg said that the goal is to build a commerce platform around messaging, starting with bringing Shops to WhatsApp and Messenger, and by building tools that let businesses follow up with customers, complete transactions, and accept payments. In a first step towards monetizing that vision in the US, Facebook began testing a new ad product, click-to-messaging, through which businesses can generate conversations with customers. That ad product, and the increased focus on commerce through messaging, helps explain Facebook’s late-November $1 billion acquisition of Kustomer (talk about a high Kustomer acquisition cost!). Kustomer is a control center for conversations that take place across channels -- from text, to email, to social media -- which fits nicely with Facebook’s goal of unifying messaging, and also uses AI to handle simple requests, which should allow businesses to deal with increased conversation volume generated by click-to-messaging ads. Just last week, Facebook rolled out more features to improve messaging-based and in-app commerce. Last Wednesday, it added carts to WhatsApp , and on Friday, it added shopping to Reels , its TikTok clone. These solutions are still clunky. In the US, for example, WhatsApp carts don’t support payments, so businesses and customers need to arrange payments separately. But Facebook recently rolled out WhatsApp payments in India, where it is the country’s SuperApp, after years of government pushback. Facebook’s $5.8 billion investment in Reliance’s Jio Platforms likely helped grease the wheels. As with Marketplace in Thailand, as Facebook works out the kinks in India, it will roll out messaging-based payments to its 3.2 billion MAPs around the globe as it slowly convinces governments it can be trusted with our money. As it continues to connect its various platforms and integrate more commerce and payments functionality, Facebook will complete the most ambitious backward integration in history, from ads into eCommerce. It will own the funnel. To be sure, all of this is early and unproven, and Facebook isn’t exactly known for its product innovation. For a unification project, it all feels a bit piecemeal. Plus, the company has also faced headwinds in markets around the globe, where governments are slow to trust Facebook to handle payments. But it points to how Facebook is thinking about unifying its products to help businesses not only reach, but communicate with and sell directly to, new and existing customers, wherever they happen to be. To that end, it’s not hard to imagine that Facebook might even roll out Shops and messaging functionality through its mobile app ad network, Facebook Audience Network . The implications of that would be enormous. It would mean businesses will be able to set up … shop … anywhere they’re able to place ads today. Imagine checking out directly in ads across the internet; see, click, buy, or talk to a person (or AI) to answer any questions. If Facebook pulls off that vision, it will have its own Everywhere Store to battle Amazon’s Everything Store . Oh yeah, and one more thing… Facebook’s Next Reality Everything that Facebook has achieved on mobile is made more impressive by the fact that Facebook almost missed the platform altogether. It was a desktop-first product when it went public, and the market didn’t believe it could make the transition to mobile. The app was janky and built on HTML5 (RIP), and analysts feared that a mobile NewsFeed couldn’t support an ad load. Its shares fell from $42 to $19 in Facebook’s first three months as a public company. Zuck fixed the mobile problem by acquiring Instagram and pushing the company into a hard pivot, but it was harrowing, and he vowed to not miss the next one. To that end, Facebook made two acquisitions that are particularly intriguing: Oculus. Acquired the maker of VR headsets for $2.3 billion in 2014. CTRL-labs. In a less splashy move, acquired the brain-computing startup for between $500 million and $1 billion in 2019. As of August, Facebook rolled Oculus, CTRL-labs, Portal, and Snap Lens Studio lookalike Spark AR into Facebook Reality Labs . The division, reporting to Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth, is responsible for Facebook’s efforts in VR, AR, and the spatial computing operating system. With its hands tied on social and messaging acquisitions, eight of its last ten acquisitions have been under Facebook Reality Labs. It’s easy to dismiss the effort -- who wants Facebook controlling the Metaverse? -- but it’s showing potential. Portal. After a chilly reception that went something like “no fucking way am I letting Zuck into my house,” Portal sales have taken off during the pandemic. My sister lives in Ghana, and she and my mom talk over Portal every day. When we’re all physically distanced, the Portal can make people feel closer together. Oculus. Facebook lowered the price point for the Oculus Quest 2, it’s newest VR headset, to $299, and pre-orders surpassed the original Oculus’ by 5x. Oculus Quest 2 is the best standalone headset on the market, and is likely to be the best-selling of all-time. Spark AR. While this is a painfully blatant rip off of Snap, the same logic I used for Snap holds here: by putting lightweight AR in hundreds of millions of peoples’ hands, Facebook is getting an early headstart on building Mirrorworld. AR Glasses. Facebook has plans to release AR glasses next year, in partnership with Luxottica. Early attempts to build AR glasses -- from Google Glass to Snap Lenses -- have ranged from butt-of-joke to toy-like, but if Facebook can marry what’s worked in Oculus with the lighter touch needed for AR, it has a shot. Just like Facebook’s social apps, the Facebook Reality Labs products will work together, in this case to try to usher in the era of spatial computing on Zuck’s terms. To become the platform, Zuck predicts the company needs to sell 10 million Oculus headsets in order to attract enough developers to build an ecosystem. That’s why the company dropped its price to $299. The prize couldn’t be bigger: if Facebook becomes the default platform for VR, AR, or both, it will hold the position that Apple and Google hold in mobile today. Plus, it will be able to plug in its social, messaging, and commerce features to the new platform from day one, creating new opportunities for businesses, and of course, for Facebook itself. Is Facebook owning a foundational Metaverse platform a good thing? Probably not. Over the past two weeks, I finally read Ernest Cline’s 2012 Metaverse instant classic, Ready Player One , and his new sequel, Ready Player Two , so I’m on high-alert. If the real thing turns out to be anything like the books’ fictional OASIS, the decisions that the platform owner makes will have an unprecedented impact on billions of lives. Ready Player One takes place in a VR world powered by an advanced Oculus Quest-like headset. Ready Player Two raises the stakes when it moves players from VR headsets to ONI, a non-invasive neural interface through which players can control their avatars and experience others’ lives just by thinking. Facebook has its own answer to ONI in CTRL-labs, which brings great promise and great danger, and will need to be regulated appropriately if it comes to market. Dystopian visions aside, in both fiction and, I suspect, reality, the company that owns the Metaverse will be the most valuable in the world. We’re many years away, and I prefer Tencent and Epic’s more decentralized approach , but Facebook is a contender, and you get that upside potential for free. Putting it All Together Facebook is hard to love. Concerns around privacy and anticompetitive behavior abound, it rips off other companies’ product work, and I’m not convinced Mark Zuckerberg isn’t a robot. But as Ben Graham told a young Warren Buffett, “In the short run, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long run, it’s a weighing machine.” Facebook will do more than $80 billion in revenue with gross margins over 80% and EBITDA margins over 40%. Half of the people in the world outside of China use its products. It’s built arguably the best business model in the world. It stands to benefit as much as anyone this side of Seattle from the dramatic and sudden shift to eCommerce. But despite that, it’s trading at the lowest P/E multiple among FAAMG, eCommerce, and social media companies. There are obvious headwinds. We’ve discussed many in the piece, including an active antitrust lawsuit, and we haven’t even mentioned two of the strongest: Apple’s IDFA update in iOS 14 which will hurt Facebook’s ability to collect data and target customers in apps. TikTok may steal attention, the lifeblood of an Aggregator, from Facebook, or at the very least, hamper its ability to acquire young users. But Facebook is undervalued relative to any set of peers, and that’s before taking its bets on the future into consideration. In the near-term, it is unifying messaging, social, and commerce in the most ambitious backward integration in history. Long-term, it may become the platform on which the Virtual Reality economy is built. And we got through this without mentioning Facebook’s crypto project (currently: Diem ) 😏\\xa0 or its Giphy acquisition . I love finding an overblown bearish narrative. Normally, I disagree with its sentiment. In this case, I agree -- Facebook feels icky -- but in this market , I’m not letting a little ick get in the way of a good value. Thanks to Dan and Puja for editing! You’re both the Sheryl to my Zuck. Full Disclosure: I own shares in Facebook which make up less than 2% of my portfolio. This is NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE and I am not a registered financial adviser or CFA. I’m a guy who writes a free newsletter. Caveat emptor. Thanks for reading, and I’ll see you on Thursday, Packy\", 'For as long as most people\\xa0can remember, the tech industry has had a new centre roughly every fifteen years. A model of computing sets the agenda, and the company or companies that win that model dominate the industry, and everyone is scared of them, and then a new model comes along, forms a new centre, and the old model stops mattering.\\xa0 Mainframes were followed by PCs, and then the web, and then smartphones. Each of these new models started out looking limited and insignificant, but each of them unlocked a new market that was so much bigger that it pulled in all of the investment, innovation and company creation and so grew to overtake the old one. Meanwhile, the old models didn’t go away, and neither, mostly, did the companies that had been created by them. Mainframes are still a big business and so is IBM; PCs are still a big business and so is Microsoft. But they don’t set the agenda anymore - no-one is afraid of them. Today, multitouch smartphones are getting on for 15 years old, and the S curve is flattening out. All the obvious stuff has been built, Apple and Google won, and the new iPhone isn’t very exciting, because it can’t be. So, we ask “what’s the next generation?” There are several ways to try to answer this. First, each of the previous S Curves unlocked a dramatically new market, but well over 4bn people have a smartphone today and there are only 5.7bn adults on earth. We can’t unlock a radically bigger market on that axis - we’ve run out of people. Yes, we will probably deploy billions more sensors around the world, but a street light\\xa0that phones home if the bulb fails is not a new platform, even if it uses a neural network (AI!) and a radio (5G!). So, in one important way, that growth model seems to be complete. A second approach would be to ask - ‘what’s in the labs?’ I made this slide for a presentation I gave in Davos at the beginning of the year (which now feels like a decade ago) - I’m sure people will disagree with my allocations, but the point is to try to think about the stages and applicability. There’s a huge amount of innovation and a huge amount of primary technology creation going on at the moment, but there always is - the question here is how universal something could become. Hence, most of these could be very important to society, but plant-based meat or micro-satellites are not a model to replace smartphones or search as primary levers of the tech industry. Theoretically, a neural interface of some kind could do that, but the technology to make that more than a way to turn on a light or open a door seems to be decades away - this is science fiction, not a forecast. The device model that could perhaps replace the smartphone is VR, or AR, or both. These cannot reach more people than smartphones (again - we ran out of people) but they could nonetheless replace the experience. At the moment this is pretty speculative. We have VR devices that are good for games and some narrow industrial use cases and there is a hope that the hardware and software can grow to become universal, but it’s not yet clear if following the hardware roadmap is all that’s needed for that to happen, or if VR needs some fundamental change if it’s to be more than a deeper and narrower subset of the games console industry (I wrote about this here ). AR glasses, on the other hand, are still a frontier science question - can we create optics that look like a normal pair of reading glasses (or, one day in a few decades, contact lenses) and yet that can put something into the world that looks as though it’s really there, in broad daylight, with a good field of view? And if we can, as for VR, it’s magical, but how useful is that? Looking at this stuff today is rather like seeing a multitouch demo in 2005 - it’s clearly good for something, but what? However, all of this might be the wrong mental model for thinking about the next step. As well as looking at the sequence ‘mainframe - PC - web - smartphone’, we should probably also think about what was going on underneath: ‘database - client/server - open source - cloud’, perhaps. That is, there are other progressions that are less visible but just as important. On that model, the fundamental trends of today are clearly machine learning and, perhaps, crypto. It’s very obvious that we are remaking the tech industry around machine learning, and probably a lot of other industries as well, and while there is a clear reason why there might not be anything after smartphones any time soon, I don’t think anyone would argue there won’t be anything after machine learning - there is a continuous process of innovation and creation (and, indeed, a pendulum, from server to local and back again). Meanwhile, if you come from Silicon Valley then things like cloud and SaaS seem like old and boring topics, but only around a quarter of large enterprise workflows have moved to the cloud at all so far - the rest are still ‘on-prem’ in old systems and indeed in mainframes. There is a huge amount of work and company creation to moving (a lot of) the rest in the next decade or two (this, really, is what I think ‘digital transformation’ means). There’s one more model to think about, though. We’ve spent the last few decades getting to the point that we can now give everyone on earth a cheap, reliable, easy-to-use pocket computer with access to a global information network. But so far, though over 4bn people have one of these things, we’ve only just scratched the surface of what we can do with them. There’s an old saying that the first fifty years of the car industry were about creating car companies and working out what cars should look like, and the second fifty years were about what happened once everyone had a car - they were about McDonalds and Walmart, suburbs and the remaking of the world around the car, for good and of course bad. The innovation in cars became everything around the car. One could suggest the same today about smartphones - now the innovation comes from everything else that happens around them.', \"Subscribe now Today I’m interviewing Laura Stratte , a registered nurse, 12-year breast cancer survivor, and until recently, breast cancer care navigator. Laura is now a program & ops manager with Elektra Health , a women's health startup in the menopause space. We discuss: The role of a cancer care navigator and what their tools and processes look like The journey of a breast cancer patient and issues that arise along the way Second opinions, clinical trials, and patient communication generally How COVID might change breast cancer care in the future What's your background, current role, and the latest cool healthcare project you worked on? My background is varied - first degree in fine art, realized it’s really hard to pay rent when you’re an artist, went into nonprofit administration for several years, then actually got to use my degree with a small necktie company - it was a very small operation so we all did everything, marketing, shipping, customer service, design. I finally made my way to nursing school and have been an RN for 11 years - I worked in informatics during a massive migration from mostly-paper to mostly-EHR in 2010-2012 and moved into oncology where I’ve been ever since. I was diagnosed with breast cancer while in nursing school, and after that I knew I wanted to go into oncology nursing and navigation, and I ended up working at the hospital system and cancer program where I was treated. The latest project I’ve been working on is starting to build a comprehensive survivorship program for a multi-site site cancer program, each site with its own org structure and culture. Survivorship care has many different models, but in essence, it’s addressing the long and late term side effects that cancer and cancer treatment cause (physical, emotional, financial, sexual, practical, etc.), health promotion and fostering healthy lifestyles, and ensuring and coordinating appropriate follow up for cancer screening and surveillance.\\xa0 COVID derailed it for a time but now we are trying to get things moving again, but I’m excited about the changes that are happening in healthcare right now because of COVID, especially the opportunities that telehealth offers. Can you walk me through a step by step of what happens when a patient comes in for their first treatment in chemo or radiation therapy? What are common issues that come up? The cancer care journey and all of the issues that go along with it start well before treatment - it really starts with the screening/work up which leads to the diagnosis. It can vary by cancer type and the specific situation, but the route often looks like: screening (maybe) > diagnostic work-up (imaging, labs, biopsy) > additional post-diagnosis imaging > MD consult > perhaps more imaging/tests > development of treatment plan > start treatment. So there is a lot of room for issues to pop up. There are barriers to care from the healthcare and institution side (insurance or lack thereof, cost of care, prior authorizations, scheduling issues with scans/surgeries) and from the patient side (transportation, communication, employment, mental health issues, co-morbidities, support, financial status, etc.). I’ll cover what happens with breast cancer patients from the point of diagnosis, which is where the navigators in my center step in, and I’ll just deal with this small part. Step 1: Post-diagnosis/pre-consult testing Immediately after diagnosis, many patients will get a breast MRI and ideally, this done before step 2 below. The MRI takes a closer look at the breasts and may lead to additional biopsies. Scheduling and/or insurance authorization can be issues here. Our weekly tumor board (meeting where the whole team of players - radiology, pathology, physicians, genetics, nurses, rehab, research -\\xa0 review cases and discuss treatment options),\\xa0 and new patient consults are on Wednesday and sometimes there are no open MRI slots before that Wednesday clinic, or we can’t get it approved before then, so the MRI doesn’t happen. We’ve gotten much better at the insurance prior auths over the years - we now have a whole department of people whose job it is to manage it - it used to be the RNs. For the MRI openings, this is a recurring issue that gets resolved, pops back up again, etc. Here we need to play a delicate balance - it’s not ideal for the patients to meet with the doctors without all of the information like the MRI - it’s frustrating for both sides not to have all of the info in that first conversation. But if we push back the appointment by another week, it’s really really hard for the patients to wait, and they may decide to go to another system that will get them in for the MRI first. Getting Her2neu\\xa0ISH (in situ hybridization) testing back in time - (About 20% of breast cancers are Her2neu positive, which means they have extra proteins that promote cell growth - think cancer cells on steroids. We have drugs that specifically target Her2, so we test all invasive cancers for this). Some women will need to get this additional Her2neu testing done and this is a send out and can take around 5 days to get back. It’s best to have this back by the Wednesday clinic, but depending on the timing of the initial biopsy, it’s not possible, or there have been many periods where the outside lab gets really really slow in turnaround. Another delicate balance to play - Whether a patient is Her2neu negative or positive can have a big effect on the treatment discussion and treatment plan. Step 2: Breast Multidisciplinary Clinic (MDC) We have a weekly multidisciplinary clinic (MDC)\\xa0that we hold weekly and we bring in all new patients from the week. At this appointment, they see their whole care team - surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, maybe plastic surgeon, and they’ll see our rehab therapist briefly for arm measurements and they’ll meet with the navigators as well. Most patients leave with a tentative treatment plan in place, with clear next steps. This 3-4 hour long mega appointment can be problematic for some - it can be tough for some patients or their support people to take time off of work (they need at least the whole morning off), arrange transportation, childcare, etc. Do we need to hook them up with their medicaid transportation benefit or do we need to use Lyft?\\xa0Do we need to connect them with our social workers right away? This model can be simply overwhelming for some patients, especially if there are underlying anxiety or cognitive issues - and if known in advance, we try to change it up, so they may only see a single physician that day. But even without anxiety or other issues - it’s still a tough, long, grueling morning. MD scheduling can be an issue here. If the referred surgeon is on vacation, what do you do? Step 3: Post-MDC testing/procedures Often patients will need some additional testing done after review at tumor board and MDC before a treatment plan can be finalized or treatment can start. For example, staging scans might be ordered to see if the patient has metastatic disease - this can drastically change treatment. Other patients may need some pre-testing done in anticipation of treatment - for certain chemo regimens, you’ll need an echo to check heart function, you’ll need to get a port placed (done outpatient in interventional radiology). Some patients may need to get pre-op clearance from a cardiologist or primary care physician. These may require insurance prior auth, which always has the ability to hold things up. Again, we may be at the mercy of scheduling - PET, CT, etc may be booked for a week. IR might not have an opening. Some patients may not have a cardiologist or PCP - no one may have an opening for weeks, so this usually involves reaching out directly to MDs to see if\\xa0 they’d make room in their schedule. Again, patients may have significant barriers to take time off of work, with transportation. We do our best to bundle appointments so they are back to back, or at least on the same day but that’s not always possible. Even before the patient comes in, navigators assess their barriers and try to get them connected with resources from the start. Transportation (social worker), insurance/charity care (financial advocate), and social services (social worker) are usually the first referrals we do. Another common issue that pops up along the way is something that’s inherent to the cancer experience - the waiting, the uncertainty, the expectations vs reality, and the little surprises that pop up that can so easily throw things off, even if those little surprises are relatively insignificant. It’s hard to manage your emotions when you are teetering on the edge and that’s what\\xa0 you often feel like when you are diagnosed. Getting diagnosed with something like cancer and going through treatment is like adding a part-time job onto your life, one that you don’t have much control over. We are thrusting patients into this system that is super complex, often incredibly disjointed, usually last minute - this emotional element adds another layer of complexity and can be really challenging to manage both from the clinician and patient sides. What software do you find yourself spending the most time and what's the most frustrating part/if you could wave a magic wand and fix one or two things, what would they be? So much time is spent tracking patient status and patient data, and we don’t have any good tools to do so. The EHR is not a patient management system, and there are some navigation software systems out there but my health system hasn’t invested in them. We’ve created our own systems to track patients as they progress so we can keep tabs on them\\xa0 - which often involves paper charts/binder, Google docs, and spreadsheets that we constantly update and work from. We are always looking at schedules, EHR, etc. to see when the patient has appointments, if they have appointments, etc, what this MD note said, etc. There’s a lot of double charting, redundancy, and time spent on manual look up and entry. And this need lasts after active treatment is completed - Did the patient come back in for their 6 month follow up? Did they get their follow up mammogram? In addition to tracking patients to help manage them, we need to track patients for data - how long between diagnosis and MDC? What surgery did the surgeon recommend vs what did the patient elect - is there a trend? What chemo regimen was used? What about radiation protocol? Did the patient leave the system- if so, why? How many patients were diagnosed at stage III? Stage IV? In our center, all of this data is expected to be collected and reported as needed by the navigators\\xa0 - we do this all by spreadsheet. A true patient management system would be the solution - We need a system with a patient dashboard, so we can see where the patient is in treatment, and what is going on with them, where we can get alerts for certain events or non-event (no shows), where we can track referrals to ancillary services, etc. and where we can query and report. How do patients prefer communicating and what kinds of things are they typically asking/looking for from their navigator? We usually communicate via phone but will use email and snail mail as well and for some conversations, it’s best to be in person so patients will often see if we’re available when they’re in the clinic, and vice versa. Patients come to us for anything and everything. Navigators are often the one constant throughout the entirety of treatment, we are usually available (or they know we’ll call back soon), and we’re able to help with most things because we bridge so many different disciplines. Even once they get into chemo and radiation and we take a step back, we are often the ones they turn to first. Lots of calls about symptoms, appointments, looking for reassurance when they are in panic mode, asking for clarification about something they heard from their MD, their friend, online, etc. (especially in the beginning). Years after treatment, patients will still call us for all sorts of random reasons. When I was diagnosed, I have to say I’m not sure I would have gotten through it all as easily as I did without my navigator\\xa0 - she was my rock, my constant, she would just make me feel better when I saw her. I was closer to her than to my doctors and really trusted her opinion. How do you interact with the physicians/oncologists, etc.? Are they leaning on you for help in specific areas? We work in a really strong team environment - for the most part, we trust and respect each other. We’re all jammed into one building, so we are constantly stopping by each other’s offices, or in the hall, we message and text. The MDs rely on us to manage tumor board, make sure the initial clinic runs smoothly, make sure patients are prepped for that first clinic appointment so the patient isn’t hearing about the possibility of a mastectomy, or chemo, etc. for the first time from them, to help when there are patient issues, to get things scheduled, to make sure they have the proper records/results when the patient comes in, to step in if there are any issues with other departments, to remind them of things (for example - many patients elect not to do genetic testing right up front, but they want to do so at some point down the line - the navigator is the one that remembers to make sure the patients eventually gets to the genetic counselor). Do you typically talk to patients about potential clinical trials? How do patients think about decisions around new treatments? At our tumor board, research will screen patients and flag those that are eligible or potentially eligible for trials. I’ll talk to patients about it but very generally because our research RNs and coordinators do a really good job of getting in touch with patients and explaining it all. I’ve been a bit more looped into a few trials where I was involved in recruitment but they weren’t drug trials - I haven’t actually gotten a lot of questions about pharma trials since many are for the metastatic setting and I don’t work with that population. The discussions I have had about drug trials tend to be around the question “what if I participate and I don’t get the trial drug.” When I do talk to patients, it’s more of a “clinical trial participation is good” pep talk and I stress how this is a way to help someone else down the line. We’re actually starting a clinical trial with people who declined participation, to learn more about why - not sure how accrual is going on that one but I suspect it’s challenging. How/when do patients typically look for a second opinion? Is that common/is there something common between the patients that ask for one? This is a super common question. In my experience, younger women tend to get second opinions, as do women with more complicated or advanced cases. The main reasons people will ask are : 1) the patient’s friends or family are telling them to go see Dr. X at X system - sometimes they can really put a lot of pressure on the patient to do so - most of the time at my center, family/friends encourage them to go to the local academic medical center, and there’s definitely clout that comes along with being in an academic center vs community hospital, 2) that’s what they heard/read that you should always do 3) they don’t like what they hear (eg the doctor is recommending mastectomy or chemo, or something that the patient does not want to do) 4) they don’t like the doctors/our center for whatever reason 5) the doctor is giving them options between treatments - making that decision is really difficult for patients because you’re being asked to choose between two options you really know very little about, 6) the case is super complicated - in which cases MDs may actually suggest getting a second opinion. Usually people will get second opinions right in the beginning, but I’ve also seen patients get them after surgery when there’s unexpected pathology (usually, the pathology proves worse disease than what was thought clinically.) I always tell people that it’s never a bad idea to get a second opinion and I never discourage it. Some breast cancers are fairly cut and dry, however, so if their case is pretty straightforward, I tell patients that the second opinion is likely to be the same or very similar, so if you feel good about our team and what they are telling you, then it’s OK to not get one (some people need to hear that, especially if they have family telling them otherwise). If the case is complicated, I may be a bit more encouraging, or even very directive. Do you think there’s anything that changed during COVID regarding cancer care that will remain permanent once COVID is over? Great question! The most obvious - virtual visits for appropriate appointment types and using more digital communication/education methods - the clinic is way too paper and phone call dependent and I think that there’s no going back. Bishal Gywali wrote a great article about this in JAMA Oncology (he tweeted the article, otherwise it’s behind a paywall). His points about selecting higher quality/value treatments and addressing screening recommendations (this is a huge topic) are spot on. There’s still a lot to learn about how some of the adjustments made to date will affect outcomes, but it’s an important conversation we need to be having. On a more granular level specifically within breast cancer care, I hope that neoadjuvant hormone therapy becomes more of a regular option for women who want to delay surgery for a bit due to life circumstances. Bonus: If you went back to being an artist right now, what kind of art would you be making? I’ll reframe this and tell you what type of artist I’d love to be: I’m obsessed with decorative arts and those artists/designers that touch the whole space -\\xa0 textile, furniture, houseware, architecture, etc. I’d be doing that and making pretty things and uncluttered spaces. Or I’d be embroidering, which is very old-ladyish of me but I get into the zone and it’s super relaxing, and I can do it while watching TV (my very favorite piece I’ve made is an embroidered quilt about TV because I love TV).

Stay tuned! Share REVISITING THE GENERALIST\\'S 2020 PREDICTIONS On January 5, in blissful ignorance, I sent \" The Nostradamus List \" to 691 subscribers. No mention was made of a strain of influenza afflicting parts of China, no space allotted to lockdowns or social distancing or face shields. Climate change was the world\\'s most pressing problem, while \"zoonotic diseases\" might as well been positioned alphabetically for the importance most ascribed to it. Then, 2020 happened. In its superlative awfulness, the last (almost) twelve months have made any predictions short of total apocalypse look quaint by comparison. Still, there is value in reviewing and reflecting on what we thought might happen. Philosopher John Searle has a good line on the matter: Prediction and explanation are exactly symmetrical. Explanations are, in effect, predictions about what has happened; predictions are explanations about what\\'s going to happen. To hone our predictions, we must practice explanation and visa-versa. And so, now more than 19,000-strong, we can look back on what I got right and (very) wrong in 2020. Here\\'s a review of my 10 predictions. \\u200b Subscribe now Prediction 1: Beyond Meat will face a backlash My prognosis The market showed plenty of appetite for Beyond Meat in 2019, with the company ending the year 64.3% above its IPO price and many hailing the product’s potential impact on the environment and broader public health. Expect a turn in 2020. \\u200b Dissenters have begun to pay attention to the high levels of saturated fats in these ostensibly healthy products, in addition to the use of protein isolates from peas or soy. A price correction for BYND will be just the beginning of this changing narrative: other plant-based proteins will need to work harder to justify their ingredients list, while lab-grown meat will attract more venture dollars, but remain content to remain in the shadows a while longer. What happened Like just about every other non-Zoom equity, Beyond Meat suffered a setback in March, making my prediction look, briefly, plausible. There\\'s no such hiding now, though: the stock rose over 80% since I made that call, pushing its price to just a tick below $140 a share and a market cap of $8.6 billion. Still, there\\'s reason to keep believing in a correction. $BYND is trading at over 20x revenue, despite just 3% year-over-year (YoY) growth last quarter and thinning gross margins. As competition increases — Nestlé\\'s \"Sweet Earth\" brand is a direct substitute — Beyond\\'s valuation may come under further pressure. I award myself no points and may god have mercy on my soul. VERDICT:\\xa0MISS \\u200b Prediction 2: Trump will win, powered by deepfakes My prognosis ...Expect a flood of concocted videos to surface on social media this summer. If Biden or Sanders win the Democratic candidacy, this will likely focus on their age and perceived infirmity. Sanders’s socialist leanings will also be exploited with ‘private footage’ — think Romney in 2012 — showing him spout hare-brained, radical leftist schemes... \\u200b Ironically, as the only certain liar, Trump will benefit, winning comfortably. Rather than countenancing rebuilding belief around a new, potentially flawed candidate, Trump-voting moderates will stick with the devil they know, while many others simply skip the polls, dissatisfied with all available options. What happened It feels good to be wrong. Rather than seeing democracy perverted by technological manipulation, the 2020 election passed without any indication of meaningful foreign intervention. That\\'s not to say it hasn\\'t been without controversy, of course, but the relative dearth of deepfakes should be seen as a victory. It did not always look so rosy. In April of this year, Trump tweeted a deepfake of Biden sticking his tongue out, an ominous sign at the time. Thankfully, that didn\\'t herald the start of a trend, with synthetic media playing a small role over the following months. Indeed, the two most notable deepfakes of the campaign season served as satire. Nonprofit RepresentUS shared a doctored video of Vladimir Putin speaking English to promote electoral reform. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone released Sassy Justice in which a Trump-inspired character interviews celebrity deepfakes about deepfakes. Meta. My friends at Charge just shared a great piece on the subject. Lots of red marker scribbled across this prediction. VERDICT:\\xa0MISS Subscribe now Prediction 3: CBD will chill out My prognosis The snake oil of 2019 will lose some of its luster. The last 12-18 months have seen CBD lauded for its range of benefits and breadth of applications, appearing in lattes, dog food, cosmetics, vitamins, hair pomade, and dozens of other inexplicable creations... \\u200b Mercifully, a decline is upon us: per Google Trends, peak CBD appears to have hit in May of this year , with interest waning since. Expect to see a steeper slump in 2020 with CBD retreating from all but the most down-the-line formulations like hand creams and oral drops, as consumers demand more explicit proof of CBD’s supposed effects. What happened Despite a global stressor exacerbating the need for legal depressants, CBD purveyors seem to have suffered this year. An annual state-of-the-industry briefing from Leaf Report indicated prices fell 17% in 2020, the result of excess hemp supply and lower than expected demand. Companies like CV Sciences, Charlotte\\'s Web, and Tilray all saw their share prices slide significantly. I think I can reasonably count this as a hit. VERDICT:\\xa0HIT Prediction 4: Fed Coin will materialize My prognosis “The Federal Reserve is not currently developing a US central bank digital currency,” chairman Jerome Powell wrote in a November letter to two congressmen, “but [we] continue to carefully examine the costs and benefits.” \\u200b 2020 will see the latter outweigh the former as China moves towards a full-scale launch of its digital renminbi, expected to be usable on both WeChat and Alipay. With Russia, Iran, and North Korea also interested in using the blockchain to skirt the US-controlled financial system, the Fed will be compelled to ensure its position as the global reserve currency is maintained in the digital realm. What happened The coronavirus stimulus package hammered home the necessity for a digital method of financial distribution. That seems to have accelerated the Fed\\'s interest in a blockchain-based solution, with Board Governor Lael Brainard noting it may bring \"greater value and convenience at lower cost.\" As part of the same conference, Brainard also shared that the Fed is working with MIT to build and test a digital currency. There\\'s likely a long road before consumers interact with \"Fedcoin.\" But Powell & Co. made meaningful steps this year, bringing it into clearer focus. I give myself a solid B. VERDICT:\\xa0MOSTLY HIT \\u200b Prediction 5: TikTok influencers will start to earn My prognosis Three years since its launch, TikTok has 500MM monthly active users, a feat that took Facebook four years, and Instagram six...[O]ne estimate suggests the top-end of TikTok influencers can earn hundreds of thousands compared to the tens of millions earned by YouTubers... \\u200b Look for this dynamic to shift in 2020 with TikTok building better analytics for brands, and making more of an effort to ensure smaller advertisers avoid FTC violations. To date, many smaller advertisers have neglected to properly tag their posts as sponsored. The result of these changes will be a more mature TikTok, friendlier to big brand dollars. As they open their wallets, expect a new level of professionalization among creators and the minting of fresh millionaires. What happened Despite falling foul of the Trump administration, TikTok\\'s growth remained impressive. In Q3 of this year, TikTok was the world\\'s most popular app, downloaded 200 million times. The increasing ubiquity and cultural relevance of the platform have proven invaluable for its creators. While there\\'s still a significant earnings gap between YouTube and TikTok personalities, stars like Addison Rae, Charli D\\'Amelio, and Josh Richards accumulated millions in earnings this year. That\\'s seen some begin to flex their growing financial muscle in other spheres — D\\'Amelio announced her first startup investment this month, backing teen banking company, Step. With over 100 million TikTok followers, Step will hope to leverage the teen\\'s distribution. We should expect other creators to follow suit into the private markets. I\\'m counting it. VERDICT:\\xa0HIT Share Prediction 6: DTC brands will take a beating My prognosis The tech industry ended the year in flames. WeWork had been shelled to pieces, Uber and Lyft smoldered, and Away was still ablaze. 2020 will see further casualties, particularly among direct-to-consumer brands. \\u200b Three unicorns will end the year struggling to justify their valuations*: \\u200b 1. Allbirds, which raised $50MM from T. Rowe at a $1.4B valuation in October 2018, will lose share to Amazon’s $35 knock-offs , the knitted and recycled creations of Reebok and Adidas, and trendy alternatives like Veja and Cariuma. I expect the company to raise an additional $20MM-35MM at a discount from their last round, before negotiating a solid if unspectacular sale in 2021. \\u200b 2. Casper’s revised mission to be the ‘ Nike of Sleep ’ will not lead it into the public markets. With a $1.1B price-tag after a $100MM top-up in May, the company has still not posted a profit. In search of a compelling narrative for investors, the mattress-maker has expanded its product line to incorporate sleep-inducing lamps, grown its digital footprint by producing guided meditation, and shifted focus to providing a superior service with plans to staff sleep experts at every store. None of these will justify a tilt at an IPO with the likeliest outcome a round of venture debt, or cut-price sale. Walmart, or existing backer, Target, look likely buyers. \\u200b 3. Away will remain a toxic tire-fire through Q1 with fresh revelations forcing more managerial turnover. Competitors like Rimowa and Paravel will turn on the gas, increasing advertising spend and taking market share. With its veneer tarnished, Away will have little choice but to close its doors or sell at a fraction of its $1.4B valuation ; I would venture 1-1.5x of an entirely speculative $45MM in revenue. What happened Casper reached the public markets roughly a month after I wrote the above, invalidating the letter of my prediction; the debacle that ensued affirmed its spirit. The stock traded down sharply, even after the company cut its IPO price. The rest of the year has been similarly cruel, with shares down about 50%, valuing a company that raised $339 million in funding at just $270 million. Allbirds endured a mixed year. The pandemic resulted in a sales slowdown, but the company did succeed in releasing a line of apparel that may improve average order size and frequency. That Allbirds raised an additional $100 million in funding at a valuation flat from its last round tells its own story. As you\\'d expect, Away seems to have been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus\\'s effect on travel, with half of the company\\'s workforce furloughed in April. The suitcase maker has been unexpectedly un-newsworthy since then, though the fact that Away\\'s \"first-ever sale\" occurred this fall may hint at looming financial difficulties. All told, I think this prediction was broadly right, but for reasons I didn\\'t incorporate into my rationale. With that in mind, I can only get partial credit. VERDICT:\\xa0MIXED \\u200b Prediction 7: You will drink Blue Tea My prognosis Pantone’s color of the year has been announced: Classic Blue . This may be just the beginning of a cerulean craze, with butterfly pea powder poised for a pop-culture moment. Often described as Blue Matcha (or “the new matcha” by the NYT ) butterfly pea powder shares little functional overlap with its namesake...prepare your feeds for the blue invasion. What happened For goodness\\' sakes. We all had much more to worry about than the color of our tea. This was a boring and unedifying prediction. I am writing \"must do better\" on my report card. VERDICT:\\xa0MISS AND DULL Subscribe now \\u200b Prediction 8: Sustainability will be the definitive status symbol My prognosis Metal straws may be distinctly out of vogue , but that won’t stop a commitment to the planet being 2020’s biggest flex. Expect red carpet treaders to discuss the environmental bonafides of their sartorial choices as consumers shift from fast-fashion factories like H&M to more mindful options. This will create an opportunity for a few resolutely environmentally conscious brands to breakout — By Humankind or For Days are candidates — encouraging a greater flurry of insurgents... What happened The pandemic appears to have accelerated interest in sustainability, with a McKinsey study indicating that consumers report acting with greater environmental-consciousness due to the virus. That includes gravitating away from fast-fashion and towards second-hand apparel. Intriguingly, just this week, clothing marketplace ThredUP released a logo designed to signify that an item was pre-owned. The company hopes that the symbol of a looping clothes hanger is used on clothes outside its platform. It\\'s one indication that brands believe they can cement sustainability as a status symbol. That said, the world\\'s mind was elsewhere this year. There were no glitzy red carpet statements (and no red carpets) that elevated the environmental cause or began a new green trend. Net/net: the changes seem to be occurring, but without the issue stealing the limelight, I only deserve a share of the spoils. VERDICT:\\xa0MIXED \\u200b Prediction 9: The Privacy Paradox will escalate My prognosis At some point in 2020 — at a dinner, or company drinks, or yoga — you, or someone you are with, will complain about the level of surveillance in our world. You might discuss the recent data breach (there will be more), the escalation of the Uighur crisis in China, the use of genetic records by police , or the slight discomfort of paying with your face . A few hours later, you will set a timer on your Alexa, query Google, and log onto Facebook. \\u200b This is the privacy paradox — the conflict between our desire to break away from abusive, data-hungry technologies, but the inability to do so given their ubiquity and usefulness. 2020 will see our cognitive dissonance strained further as we allow voice assistants into our cars , and add cameras to our streets . What happened Surveillance became a matter of public health this year as governments rolled out extensive tracking programs in response to the coronavirus. To stem the spread , Asian governments monitored cellphones (without user permission), the Kremlin leveraged facial recognition and the United States relied on data from mobile advertising firms. Meanwhile, companies responded to the challenges of a remote-only workforce by requiring the use of tools like Hubstaff, which tracks mouse movements and text entries. In some instances, we should glad for improved monitoring — it has almost certainly saved lives. But many implementations, particularly from the private sector, represent egregious overreaches. The fear is that after the crisis is over, these practices will remain. The privacy paradox seems to have deepened, making this a hit. VERDICT:\\xa0HIT \\u200b Prediction 10: The Third Halvening will lead BTC to all-time highs My prognosis Bag-holders that began 2019 in tears had something to cheer about in December: the price of bitcoin rose 88% over the intervening 12 months. While it wasn’t nearly enough to salve the wounds of those that bet heavily in 2017, it should have provided some succor. \\u200b Better days are ahead in 2020. On May 20th of this year, bitcoin production will be cut in half, meaning that 50% less bitcoin will be created every 10 minutes. This is the third iteration of ‘The Halvening’, having previously occurred in 2012 and 2016. In both instances, in the face of reduced supply, price shot up: 80x in the year after the first split, and 4x after the second. \\u200b Though some believe the effect of the halvening is already priced in, a significant bump can still be expected, driving the price above the previous high of $20K, before settling around $15K by the end of the year. This will be good news to many, disastrous news for one: rogue antivirus scion John MacAfee has promised to eat an intimate body part if the value of a single bitcoin does not reach $1MM by the end of 2020. What happened John McAfee\\'s member is still imperiled. Beyond that looming excision, the notorious bitcoin bull will be very happy with the cryptocurrency\\'s progress in 2020. Since my prediction, BTC\\'s price rose over 150% from roughly $7,400 to its current position below $19,000. That surge has been buoyed by institutional investors getting in on the action after sitting on the sidelines for 2017\\'s run-up. The intervening years have allowed hedge funds and other managers to expand their mandate to include digital currencies. Corporate action has also helped — Square spent $50 million buying bitcoin. If that proves to be the start of a trend, with other tech companies buying the cryptocurrency to keep on their balance sheet, 2021 could prove even more ebullient. Because we\\'re yet to hit a new all-time high, I can\\'t get full credit. But all in, I think I got this mostly right. VERDICT:\\xa0MOSTLY HIT What will 2021 bring?

I just got back from a week\\'s worth of hiking in Utah, which was fantastic, and am basically ready to easer into the holidays already. There\\'s been no let up in the news, so there\\'s quite a bit of ground to cover this week. Amazon and Reliance battle for dominance in retail As some / most of you probably know Amazon and Reliance (via Future Retail as proxy) are battling it out in the Delhi High Court, as they seek to tighten their grip on the country\\'s e-commerce sector. For those who aren\\'t very familiar with the story, here\\'s a bit of background. Last year Amazon bought a 49% stake in Future Coupons, an entity owned by India’s second largest retail chain, Future Retail. Reports suggest that the deal gave Amazon the first right to refusal on purchase of more stakes in Future Retail, included a non-compete clause, and the right to buy into the listed flagship FRL after a few years (probably with the aim of going through on the deal if if the government was to change the existing rules on foreign ownership of multi-brand retailers). Then in August this year Reliance Retail said it has reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter’s retail and wholesaler business, as well as its logistics and warehousing business, for $3.4 billion. The acquisition will give Reliance Retail one-third of the bricks-and-mortar retail stores. The pandemic ravaged Future Retail, which ran into a severe cash crunch as the country went into lockdown. Reliance turned out to be a white knight. The battle is particularly interesting since it was rumoured a few months ago that Amazon was considering an investment in Reliance retail, but that might have taken a backseat for now. After news of the acquisition Amazon decided to take the matter to the Singapore International Arbitration Tribunal arguing that the RIL-Future deal is a violation of the agreement it has with Future Retail, and won an injunction that temporarily restrained Future Group from going ahead with the asset sale. In response, Future Group said the matter “will have to be tested\" under Indian laws, petitioning the Delhi High Court to bar Amazon from meddling in its asset sale. In the meantime the Competition Commission of India gave the Reliance acquisition the go-ahead . Not fazed Amazon raised the injunction with the market regulator SEBI which is now asking the Bombay Stock Exchange to clarify why it cleared the share capital reorganization of Future Group despite unresolved complaints against the deal, including one by Amazon. [Quick note here that BSE CEO Aashishkumar Chauhan is a former Reliance man]. Quite honestly, what’s most interesting in this saga of both these companies trying to gain monopolistic power is how they are arguing their case. Amazon says that this spat is about India’s willingness to enforce business contracts and what this deal says about India’s ability to attract foreign investment. I have some sympathy for this view since the two parties had consented to settle their disputes through arbitration in accordance with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre’s rules. Future Retail’s lawyers are leaning heavily into the the atmanirbhar zeitgeist arguing that Amazon is behaving “ like the East India Company of the 21st century. ” It’s a line of reasoning I have real distaste for, not only because as a historian I know this analogy to be wrong (the East India Company had an army to actually force the market open if you want to go down that route) but also because this appeal to nationalism is both dangerous and hypocritical. Indian companies are too happy to play the nationalist card while also happily taking foreign investment (Reliance was ground zero for FDI this past year) and selling consumers foreign-made goods. To be clear, I think access to foreign capital and goods is a good thing, and businesses should pushing for more open markets with consistent regulation - and dispute resolution mechanisms - but that’s clearly a pipe dream these days. Weekly Recap: Companies enabling WFH are raising capital : With WFH becoming the norm during the pandemic, two interesting start-up trends are emerging. First, Indian SaaS companies are raising capital and building for a global companies from day 1. Two, a host of US-based companies (think Hublio and Airmeet) are expanding to India as there is a very real market need for such products and a propensity to pay. Cuemath raises a $40M Series C : In more edtech news, Cuemath has raised $40M in a Series C round co-led by Lightstone Fund and Falcon Edge’s Alpha Wave Incubation. The funding comes a year after the company\\'s $5.5M Series B and values the company >$170M. The company provides after-school math classes and has over 5K franchises in the country conducting 25M classes for 100k students. The company also grew its digital platform 4x during the pandemic. WhatsApp adds Shopping Carts : After the rollout of WhatsApp Pay, the company has now launched now shopping carts. Today\\'s launch of carts just shows how thoughtfully Facebook is thinking about enabling commerce for small businesses in India. Consumer (C) messages Business (B) about purchasing something. B sends C their catalog (in-built in WA). C creates a cart (in-built) and sends it to B. B sends C a payment request through WhatsApp pay, and C pays it. The entire process can now be completed end-to-end on WhatsApp 🤯 HDFC invests in Smallcase : India\\'s largest private sector bank HDFC has invested in Smallcase\\'s recent Series B round, which was led by the DSP Group. Existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Blume Ventures, and Beenext also participated in the round. Smallcase lets retail investors invest in a number of themed portfolios of stocks and exchange-traded funds (EFTs) by allowing users to place orders through their brokers. PubMatic goes public : PubMatic, an AdTech company, started trading on the NASDAQ today opening at $25.12 after being priced at $20 and ended the day at $29.45. The company was started way back in 2004 and has raised several rounds of funding (total raise of $63M), starting with a $7M Series A in 2008 led by Nexus Venture Partners. The company allows publishers and app developers to sell advertising space to advertisers across different media, including display or video ads on desktop, mobile app, mobile web, or connected TV. The company generated $127M in revenue in the year ending in Sep (up 33% YoY). Exotel raises 40 Cr from A91 Partners : Communications Platform as a Service Exotel has raised 40 Cr from A91 Partners in a mix of primary and secondary shares as the company is seeing a wave of accelerated growth in digital adoption due to the pandemic. The company has grown to 120 Cr in revenues (FY20) on just 2.5 Cr of total capital raised. Infra Market raises $20M in a Series B : Infra Market has raised $20M in a Series B round, with the round being led by Evolvence India Fund, Sistema Asia Fund and Foundamental, while existing investors Accel, Tiger Global and Nexus also participated. This brings the Mumbai-based company\\'s total capital raised $50M.  Infra Market is a B2B marketplace and helps small businesses (like manufacturers of paints and cements) improve the quality of their production and meet various compliances. The company essentially serves as a service layer for these small manufacturers, enabling them to grow their business. TPG looks to acquire minority stake in Pharmeasy\\'s parent :  API Holdings, the combined entity of Pharmeasy and Medlife, is raising some capital from TPG which would give the PE group 7% of the entity. Reportedly, both TPG and Naspers are also looking to invest $100M in Pharmeasy, valuing it at $1.2B, which could make the company India\\'s newest unicorn. There has been a lot of M&A activity in the online pharmacy space: Reliance acquired a 60% stake in Netmeds for 620 Cr and Amazon is potentially investing $100M in Apollo Pharmacy.

The video features our G3 robotaxi fully autonomously completing a trip with no Safety Driver behind the wheel. You can read more of the details here . This trip was recorded at our Testing Grounds in an engineering version of our G3 robotaxi. Our fleet of production G3 robotaxis are soon to hit the (public) road—returning independence to many seniors who struggle with driving. What’s special about the G3—and why we feel comfortable removing the Safety Driver here—is the comprehensive suite of safety systems. Before we hit public road, we are validating all of these systems (including our self-driving A.I. Commander , our reliable backup system Shield , and our novel approach to remote assistance Telessist ). What’s included in this video is a meaningful step forward in that important process. The First Wave of Driverless is Here It’s been a remarkable few weeks in self-driving. In addition to Voyage, a number of self-driving projects announced their own versions of removing the Safety Driver: Cruise beginning driverless testing in San Francisco Zoox recieving a permit to test vehicles without a Safety Driver in Foster City AutoX announced testing of fully driverless cars within a designated area of Shanghai Hyundai-backed Motional recieiving a permit to test vehicles without a Safety Driver in Nevada Nuro announced fully unmanned deliveries in their R2 vehicle This is in addition to Waymo and their deployment of commercial driverless . All of this activity is incredibly energizing, and reminds me of a now famous Bill Gates quote: “ We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.”\", '7-min read This is the second in a series of posts about one of the most accretive paradigm shifts in our economy since globalization and digitization — dispersion. The market added half a trillion in value in the past two weeks: AT&T busted a baller move to a rundle, the FTC filed suit against Facebook, and an overhyped DoorDash and underhyped Airbnb went public. AT&T’s announcement that it will release movies simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters predictably pissed off Hollywood players, who make millions off the current system. But Christopher Nolan calling HBO Max “the worst streaming service” is similar to JCPenney calling Amazon circa 1999 a terrible experience. Doctors, talent agents, and film directors should host a pity party at Jeffrey Katzenberg’s crib, catered by Planet Hollywood with performances from Robin Thicke and Billy Squier. (Note: you know the moment when the edible kicks in? It happened in the middle of the last sentence.) Anyway. AT&T CEO John Stankey realized the market favors recurring revenues and narrative over transactional revenues and EBITDA. Last week, the narrative was AT&T had been on the wrong side of a trade with the smartest man in media (Jeff Bewkes) and overpaid for Time Warner. Ironic that two of the five worst acquisitions in history have the same two words: Time Warner — who 18 years previous merged with AOL. An infirmed stock price is a terrible thing to waste, and AT&T’s underperformance inoculated it against the innovator’s dilemma (Ma Bell has less to lose). So it went gangster on theaters, opting for the consumer. AT&T is poised to recognize an increase of $100 billion or more in market cap in 2021 on its transition from a conglomerate that makes no sense to the world’s largest recurring-revenue firm. Next up, the FTC and 48 states filed an\\xa0antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. This formed the second of two dots, the first being the DOJ’s case against Google. Two dots make a line, and that line points towards the end of big tech as we know it. But while it’s tempting to think of these breakups as punitive, they’re actually generative. Antitrust oxygenates the marketplace, and WhatsApp and Instagram will be the next Peloton and Zoom, creating commensurate value. It was telling that this “shocking” news had little impact on the stock. There is only one stakeholder that won’t benefit from a breakup of Facebook, and he’s the most dangerous person on the planet. Finally, DoorDash, a food delivery firm with multiple well-capitalized competitors, IPO’ed and is now worth $60 billion. Its market cap is almost equivalent to Moderna, the biotech company that created a Covid-19 vaccine in less than a year. One is a warrior that may defeat a pandemic, the other delivers my burrito bowl. One is overvalued. Airbnb, however, is not. The firm’s offering price was $68, but closed at $144 per share with a market cap of over $100 billion, as I predicted . The company is dispersing the vacation travel supply chain. It has a dominant brand, a global supply network, and a talented leadership team. Bottom line, Airbnb is going public despite the pandemic, while DoorDash is going public because of the pandemic. Which would you rather own when the vaccine comes? I Platform Therefore I Crush It Last week, I wrote about the Great Dispersion and the risks and opportunities it offers. One of the forms the Great Dispersion takes is platforms. Platforms are horizontal networks that connect buyers and sellers, speakers and listeners, creators and consumers, to one another, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. (We’re launching a Platform Strategy Sprint in the spring.) The internet is such a platform, of course, and it hosts many others: Twitter and Facebook, YouTube, Etsy, eBay, and Airbnb. These platforms have become the connective tissue for billions of people. They are sub-economies that have become nation-states with market capitalizations greater than the GDP of Honduras. Building a platform can generate huge returns. In 2000, Amazon launched its own platform, permitting third parties to sell goods alongside Amazon’s own offerings. In 2017, unit sales on Amazon Marketplace exceeded Amazon’s direct offerings and have only increased their share since. In effect, Amazon became a minority player on its own platform, a result that might strike a less innovative CEO as a bad outcome. But Bezos knows platforms, and so does the market. Amazon’s stock has appreciated at 3x the pace of Walmart’s since 2017, as Amazon uses its platform dominance to create scale that is … Amazonian. Will the DOJ put an end to that dream with a third dot on our line? Or will Bezos inoculate his company against government interference (and further enrich his shareholders) with a preempting spin? My money is on the birthing of an independent organization that will be the most valuable firm in the world in 2025: AWS. Dispersion of Creativity There’s another group of platforms out there that don’t just disperse retail, but disperse creativity. Etsy — a pandemic winner whose prosperity is nothing short of inspiring\\xa0— enables artisans to reach a global audience. YouTube made video stars out of millions, and now TikTok is leapfrogging YouTube in the mobile space. Substack, Patreon, and OnlyFans are likewise disarticulating creators from traditional gatekeepers. It appears algorithms have a better eye for great content than Meg Whitman. If there aren’t any kids under 16 in your house, you might not have heard of the most exciting creative platform that hasn’t been hauled in front of Congress — Roblox . The firm just filed its S1 and, after reading it, I feel similar to how I felt after reading The Alchemist: inspired and rethinking a bunch of stuff. Roblox is a global gaming platform that disperses game creation tools to millions. And in turn, it disperses the games to tens of millions more. It has 31 million active daily users, 7 million of whom have made at least one game of their own. There’s massive competition in the video game space. So-called “Triple A” titles such as Call of Duty or Cyberpunk 2077 can cost $100 million or more to produce, and companies pour hundreds of millions more into marketing. Money follows attention, and one firm has more of our children’s attention than any firm on earth. Reread the last sentence. Roblox commands the attention of America’s kids to the tune of 2.6 hours per day . And it does so with games that largely avoid the violence and dystopia of those $100 million blockbusters. Some of the most popular games on the Roblox platform are about adopting digital pets, building virtual communities, and running a pizza restaurant. The audience skews younger than the traditional video game market as well: 54% of users are under 13. Unlike Facebook, whose concern for the well-being of kids lies somewhere between Michael Jackson and the Catholic Church (can’t wait for the hate mail on that one), Roblox appears to be run by people who act as if they have children of their own. The word safety appears 121 times in the S1, which is 8x more than in Facebook’s. And the word parental appears six times in Roblox’s S1 and … zero times in Facebook’s. The company employs both filtering software and content moderators, who have reviewed over 68 million digital assets this year alone. By dispersing tools to millions, Roblox has made money for independent developers and created a flywheel for its own future growth. Nearly 1 million creators earned Roblox’s in-game currency (“Robux”) with their creations, and over a thousand have made over 10,000 real dollars in the past 12 months. 250 of its creators made over $100,000. While Roblox pays out about a third of its revenues to its creators, what it gets in return is a deep collection of content and a powerful marketing engine, as creators and users share their experiences organically. The company’s sales and marketing expenses are less than 10% of revenue. Facebook spends 14%, and Twitter 26%. Of Roblox’s 830 full-time employees, 79% of them are engineers — making it more of a purely technology company than Apple, Netflix, or Google. One thing Roblox hasn’t delivered yet is profit, losing $200 million on $588 million in revenue for the first nine months of 2020. But the hallmark of a flywheel is momentum, and Roblox is spinning up fast. Prepaid revenues were $1.2 billion in the first nine months, and are growing 171% year over year. Negative working capital is a concept I understand well enough to know it’s awesome. Roblox could be to Facebook what Shopify is to Amazon, the non–social media social media firm. Just as hospitals, doctors offices, headquarters, shopping malls, and campuses are being bypassed and shifting hundreds of billions in stakeholder value, Roblox could disrupt the kid attention economy. Roblox is set to go public this month, and will create meaningful shareholder value. Prediction: stock trades up 70% or more on first trade. More important, Roblox could be the first social media firm whose shareholder value isn’t designed to extract value from the least powerful stakeholder, kids. Facebook and Roblox. One firm is being broken up, the other going public. The world has endured a virus that has levied tremendous damage to the commonwealth. It has also endured Covid-19. Roblox will be a great stock and, more important, might pull off a jailbreak from the menace economy of big tech, which arbitrages depression, desperation and dissent.

Sharing and Owning Standards The only way to get a lot done is to spend essentially no time on  unnecessary decisions. Some people manage this in their life—delegating  the boring stuff, keeping a precise schedule, wearing and eating the  same thing all the time, ruthlessly turning down interesting  distractions. And companies do it, too, often through official or  implicit standards. Standards are an interesting economic good. They’re a public good,  because by definition everyone has to know the rules in order to follow  them. But they’re often provided by the private sector; governments can  be a coordinating point for imposing a standard, but the rules  themselves come from private actors. An interesting and relatively early example comes from the auto  industry. In the early 1900s, the car industry was small, and fragmented. Cars were expensive, bespoke, and mostly made  for rich hobbyists. Even small industries can go through boom and bust  cycles, and one early cycle was driven by the classic bugaboo of small  businesses: supplier concentration and working capital risk. Since every  car company used unique designs, they ordered unique parts. But cars  are full of essential parts: if you have everything you need to build a  car, except the axles, or the spark plug, or a particular screw, you  have lots of expensive inventory on the books and no cars to sell. So, in 1905 a group of car company representatives formed the Society  of Automotive Engineers. Their goal was to agree on the dimensions and quality of the basics: tires, screw threads, lock washers, etc. In many cases, they didn’t  narrow things down to one model, they just picked the most popular 20%  or so of designs and made those the acceptable ones. This improved the  economics for both the carmakers themselves and their suppliers: car  companies could expect backup suppliers if their main provider failed,  and suppliers had backup customers, too. Even though the largest car  companies didn’t participate in early standardization efforts, overall  adoption of the standards exceeded 90% within a decade. By 1921, a trade journal estimated that standardized parts were  saving the industry $750m a year, or 15% of the entire value of car  sales. The industry didn’t need a top-down mandate to enforce this—even within the auto industry, the change was driven by smaller companies, not top-down. All it  really needed was an industrial cluster and a shift in inputs—parts  shortages led to less work for car workers, which meant a surplus of  free time that they could use to hash out disagreements over carburetor  lever arms and the like. Standardization is not always an unambiguous win. In the early days  of the credit card industry, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express all  figured out that they’d be better off with a default set of card  dimensions, point of sale specs, and the like; better to make  manufacturing a commodity business so they could focus on the pure-play  network-effects payment product. But this meant that when Sears launched  the Discover Card in 1985, there were compatible card readers and card  manufacturers, and consumer habits were already ingrained. Within two years  of launch, they were the third largest credit card brand in the US, with  22m accounts. IBM famously built its PCs with commodity components, and  let Microsoft license a variant of the most popular IBM PC operating  system to other manufacturers. In short order, competitors who didn’t  have IBM’s R&D or administrative overhead were stamping out much  more affordable clones. Creating a standard seems to be most effective as a way to commoditize the complement .  A company can make one part of its product an open standard, because it  has a competitive advantage in benefiting from more supply of whatever  product it commoditizes. A fun example of this comes from the world of  tabletop role-playing games. In 2000, Dungeons & Dragons released a generic role-playing system that could be grafted on to other themes, like superheroes, spies, and Star Wars . One paper shows that the number of new tabletop gaming companies rose from 20 in  1998-99 (before the introduction of D20) to 68 from 2000-1, after, while  employees per game company dropped by half. So, Dungeons & Dragons' publisher had many new competitors. But  that also meant that many more people had 20-sided dice and knew the  basic mechanics of games. Since playing a game means matching a group of  players who are all interested in the same game, an increase in the  number of games published, and the number of unique players, can be a  net benefit for the biggest incumbent: among any random set of  d20 players, the system they’re all most likely to be familiar with is  D&D; there isn’t data available, but it’s possible that this open system both reduced D&D’s share of total players and increased its share of total tabletop games played, by adding so many nodes to the network. (This same dynamic played out in credit cards: Discover was  able to grow fast, because Sears was a major merchant at the time,  bootstrapping the network effect. But eventually, the much larger Visa  and Mastercard networks won out, and Discover’s importance waned.) Some standards persist even though they’re imperfect, because they  give every better product something to measure itself against. FICO  scores are imperfect, but various attempts to replace them haven’t  caught on. Since it’s hard to have a full-time job that consists of 1)  checking FICO scores and then 2) approving every loan above a threshold,  the FICO standard is sticky because every credit analyst can benchmark  default rates to them. A similar dynamic holds in bond ratings: BBB  persists as a rating because credit managers want to show that they earned BB-level  returns while taking single-A risk. A standard doesn’t have to be perfect, or even consciously designed,  to keep working. In fact, they’re more effective when they canonize the  market share leader as the only way to do things. This means they often  echo much older technological decisions: programmers generally use up to  80 characters per line, because early computer displays were exactly 80  characters wide, and that was because IBM’s punched cards were 80 columns. A standard is suspiciously similar to a software product: it consists  entirely of information, and can be produced at nearly zero marginal  cost. In fact, the category of software it’s most similar to is the API.  There are open standards for building web pages that any browser can  read (HTML, Javascript) and there are closed standards for turning that  page into a page that can send a text message (Twilio), collect a  payment (Stripe), force users to prove that they’re human (reCAPTCHA),  match free-form text input to specific entities (Bing Entity Search),  etc. In one sense, an API is just a privately-held standard: it has the  same net economic benefits, but the standard creator earns a royalty on  their use, rather than giving them away. This has some complicated  effects: The first-order impact is that it leads to more standards for more  products. Public goods tend to get underproduced, but if there’s an  entity that captures the upside, it has an incentive to create them.  That’s especially true for anything that has a low-but-nonzero cost;  running it as a public service is prohibitively expensive, but when it’s  charged for it’s a trivial cost. Over the long term, though, it can discourage certain kinds of users . When car companies standardized, they deliberately avoided standards  for the parts of cars that were changing the fastest. If there’s a  default way to build an engine, that’s the end of innovation in engines;  better for each unit produced to be a bit more expensive and for the state of the  art to keep on advancing. But revenue-generating APIs are also information -generating  APIs; when Twilio sees a great service built on Twilio, they know  they’re getting revenue, but they also know that they could capture more  revenue by turning that service into a feature. An API company is a standards-producing body with a scheming brain  attached. Standards bodies, of course, are run by human beings, but they  have a definite lifespan, defined by the job tenure of the people  running them. One of the most interesting tidbits from The Box (also a story about standardizing!) was that shipping  companies were able to get unions on board with labor-saving technologies because the shipping  company is immortal, while union members don’t have a strong economic  interest in what happens to their job after they retire. So a company  with a low discount rate can buy cooperation from a person with a higher  discount rate. Some companies that rely on APIs worry that they’re just doing  R&D for their biggest supplier—this is a common fear about AWS, for  example. So it’s in the interest of API providers to define what  businesses they don’t want to be in. There has been immense value in standardization for a very long time,  and it’s easy for even smart people to miss: Charles Kindleberger once  pointed out that in The Wealth of Nations , Adam Smith doesn’t  understand why a merchant shipping between two countries in Europe would  have both shipments stop by the port of Amsterdam on the way to their  destination. Smith attributed this to nervous merchants who didn’t want  goods out of their sight for long, but Kindleberger notes that one of Amsterdam’s  major industries was the measuring and grading of commodities. 17th and  18th century Amsterdam was the ancient ancestor to modern  pay-per-API-call businesses: a network effects-driven economic actor  that specialized in taking lumpy and complicated inputs and outputs, and  converting them into a form that everyone could understand and use.

Elsewhere I went on the Conservative Curious podcast to talk about legitimacy and institutions. And I’m in Palladium with a piece on why the US dollar will remain a reserve currency for a long time . More Institutional Bitcoin A few months ago, when Paul Tudor Jones announced that he owned Bitcoin, I wrote that the real meaning of this was not that a relatively fast-money  investor was buying, but that institutions with longer-term outlooks  were more likely to buy in the future. MicroStrategy and Square followed  up with Bitcoin purchases of their own, both buying with the intent to  hold, and now MassMutual owns Bitcoin, too ($, WSJ ).  This position is a tiny piece of their portfolio, just 4 basis points  out of $235bn in assets. But it’s another step towards Bitcoin being  treated as an alternative reserve asset. (Disclosure: I am long Bitcoin.) The Latest Asset to Trade at Negative Prices Ubisoft is paying players $10 to try one of its free-to-play games .(It’s  a $10 credit for any other Ubisoft game, not $10 outright.) Usually,  bundling means getting X+Y for less than the price of X plus the price  of Y, not getting X + Y for less than the cost of X. But in this  context, it makes sense: free-to-play economics are driven by people  hanging out in-game and buying cosmetic goods, so Ubisoft is encouraging  people to migrate to the game so that once they’ve homesteaded a bit,  they can be taxed. Facial Recognition The governor of Massachusetts is refusing to sign a bill that would ban facial recognition ,  arguing that it’s helped catch murderers and sex offenders. The  technology is extremely controversial, but at this point inevitable; the  relentless drop in hardware prices, and the high conversion rate from  publishing interesting ML papers to fielding multiple mid-six figure  offers from major tech companies, ensures that the technology will be  widely available no matter what. It’s already being implemented in other parts of the world , so policymakers outside of China can’t determine whether or not it will be used, just whose interests it will be used in. Recursive Product Development DoNotPay, which provides easy access to legal services like disputing  parking tickets, getting refunds, and collecting security deposits,  now offers freedom of information act requests as a service . FOIA requests are a popular tool for investigative journalism , and they also have entertainment value . But what’s especially interesting about this launch is the backstory: Browder said that DoNotPay “would not exist” without FOIA  laws. “When we got started appealing parking tickets, we used previous  requests to see the top reasons why parking tickets were dismissed,” he  said. Browder said he’s hoping the feature will help consumers uncover  more injustices — just like with parking tickets — to feed his product  with more features. “The overall strategy is to use any interesting FOIA  data to build great new DoNotPay products,” he said. It’s commoditizing the complement all the way down. Every Tech Company Becomes a Bank Back in June, I noted that the threshold for venture-fundable niche startups was lower than I’d thought , because Squire, a company that sells software for barbershops, raised $34m. They’ve now raised another $45m , at triple the valuation. One reason is that they’ve moved from pure software to financial services: The coronavirus has threatened the livelihoods of small  and medium-sized business owners, making it harder for them to secure  loans or financing to undergo tricky times. Salvant says that Squire  took on $15 million in debt financing to create a banking-as-a-service  feature for these business owners. This is an interesting variant on the general idea that more  debt-based financing is coming to software companies. These companies  are also a good conduit for credit: they get real-time data on  how businesses are performing, and they have direct relationships with  clients. Adding a layer of banking on top of their product is a good way  to lock in customers, and to arbitrage the gap between cheap capital  for startups and expensive capital for low-growth small businesses. Can Anyone Afford for Robinhood Not to Underwrite IPOs? The function of an IPO underwriter is to work with a company, and  with future investors, to figure out what the company will be worth when  it’s publicly traded. Normally, that involves talking to major  institutional investors, figuring out what the demand curve looks like,  and baking in a little caution (either to ensure that the IPO goes off  without a hitch or to do a very lucrative favor for clients). This is  something banks can do when there’s a finite number of buyers, but it’s  much harder with retail investors. Retail buyers are less  valuation-sensitive than institutions, and they use different platforms. Which is why the two biggest IPO pops recently have been fueled by retail investor buying .  Underwriters say that retail investor demand is hard to predict, but I  suspect that someone at Robinhood has already found the correlation  between a) the size of an IPO price pop, and b) the number of Robinhood  users who look for a stock quote for the to-be-public company. Because  Robinhood users are doing more of the research on the app itself,  Robinhood may know more about their demand than a bank knows about institutions' plans. Retail investors have always been a swing factor in IPOs. When  Netscape went public, Charles Schwab had to change their 800 number’s  recording (“Welcome to Charles Schwab. If you’re interested in the  Netscape IPO, press one…”). But now they’re a more measurable one.\"]\n"

Facebook is an advertising juggernaut on pace to do more than $80 billion in revenue this year at 80+% gross margins, which has only become more critical for advertisers during the pandemic. Because it’s hated, you get all of that at a slight discount without accounting for Facebook’s wild bets on the future. Just to be extra clear: this is not a value judgement. Facebook may very well be evil. As I was writing this post, I hopped on to Twitter, and this is the first tweet that popped into my feed: But because we all think Facebook is evil, we don’t spend much time trying to understand the full scope of the business behind the products on which we spend 65 minutes per day. What is Facebook? Facebook is so omnipresent that the analysis of the company is all trees, no forest. When I started researching this piece, I realized that despite reading Stratechery daily and spending a lot of time on tech twitter, I don’t fully understand everything the company does and how it all fits together. So let’s all admit that we’ve lost track, hit reset, zoom out, and admire the forest. Nearly half of the world’s population uses one or more of Facebook’s four main social media properties - Facebook , Messenger , Instagram , and WhatsApp . Facebook is also building what it hopes is the next computing platform through Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Oculus, Portal, Spark AR, CTRL-labs, and more.
