Facebook is an advertising juggernaut on pace to do more than $80 billion in revenue this year at 80+% gross margins, which has only become more critical for advertisers during the pandemic. Because it’s hated, you get all of that at a slight discount without accounting for Facebook’s wild bets on the future. Just to be extra clear: this is not a value judgement. Facebook may very well be evil. As I was writing this post, I hopped on to Twitter, and this is the first tweet that popped into my feed: But because we all think Facebook is evil, we don’t spend much time trying to understand the full scope of the business behind the products on which we spend 65 minutes per day. What is Facebook? Facebook is so omnipresent that the analysis of the company is all trees, no forest. When I started researching this piece, I realized that despite reading Stratechery daily and spending a lot of time on tech twitter, I don’t fully understand everything the company does and how it all fits together. So let’s all admit that we’ve lost track, hit reset, zoom out, and admire the forest. Nearly half of the world’s population uses one or more of Facebook’s four main social media properties - Facebook , Messenger , Instagram , and WhatsApp . Facebook is also building what it hopes is the next computing platform through Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Oculus, Portal, Spark AR, CTRL-labs, and more. The main Facebook product had 1.8 billion Daily Active Users (DAUs) and 2.7 billion Monthly Active Users\"\n",

      "Welcome to new subscribers. The Generalist helps you master the future by analyzing the most significant tech and financial market trends. Thank you for being here. There are now over 19,000 of us! Hey friends, The IPO frenzy reached its zenith with DoorDash and Airbnb making their public debuts this week. Both got off to an explosive start, with DoorDash finishing the week at a $55.5 billion valuation and Airbnb landing around $83 billion.~\n",
      "Affirm in 1 minute PayPal co-founder Max Levchin is back. Affirm, the &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; solution led by Levchin is slated to list on the Nasdaq before the year is out. The wisdom of the company&#8217;s mooted $10 billion valuation may depend on the perspective of the investor in question. Is Affirm a lender, selling a commoditized product? Or is it a payments network, capitalizing on changing consumer preferences to steal share from big banks? For Levchin, Affirm&#8217;s disruption of traditional finance is not just a commercial opportunity but a moral imperative.~\n",
      "If you&#8217;re looking for the piece &#8220;Revisiting The Generalist&#8217;s 2020 Predictions,&#8221; click here. I accidentally put the wrong link in the email &#128556; WHO IS THIS FOR? Founders. Under the leadership of Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo scaled new heights, becoming a global force. Founders may find lessons in the irascible president's ambitions and willingness to experiment.~\n",
      "Doordash in 1 minute Pandemic-favorite DoorDash is slated to IPO at a $32 billion valuation. Best-known for its food delivery marketplace, DoorDash has scaled quickly since its official launch in 2013, only accelerating during the coronavirus outbreak.~\n",
      "Airbnb in 1 minute That Airbnb is here at all is remarkable. Bludgeoned by the coronavirus, the hospitality platform has spent much of 2020 in a state of crisis, raising debt and cutting budgets. In the process, management demonstrated trademark resilience in the face of adversity, artistry amid disaster.~\n",
      "Hey everyone, It was a fun week. The S-1 Club launched on Product Hunt, reaching the #2 spot for the day. Thank you to everyone who helped make it such a success. It means a lot. As it turns out, it was fitting timing. More S-1s dropped this week, with Affirm and Roblox joining Airbnb and DoorDash in charging toward IPO. We've assembled some great teams and will cover all four. Stay tuned.~\n",
      "WHO IS THIS FOR? Founders. QR codes have yet to truly catch on in the US, despite being commonplace in China. That&#8217;s changing as the coronavirus encourages contactless interactions. Startups may form around this new behavior, and existing businesses may wish to update their practices in a bid to keep up.~\n",

      "There's only one place to begin today: thank you. Really, thank you. I have been overwhelmed by the messages of support in response to \"The Six-Billion Dollar Stare\" and the accompanying Twitter thread. You've offered to chip in to pay legal fees, you've sent me articles about compounders, you've contacted friends in high places, or you've put your own considerable might behind me. I am stunned and grateful.~\n",
      "An explanation of why The Generalist&#8217;s initial piece on compounders was removed from the website, and why it has returned in a revised form. As many of you will remember, on October 18, 2020, The Generalist published \"C.R.E.A.M.\" the first part in a series on \"compounders,\" companies that grow double-digits over an extended period.~\n",
      "Compounders rule everything around me~\n",
      "The Generalist is hosting two events with tech&#8217;s most original thinkers. You can find both here. Scarcity and Abundance in Tech Sunday, November 1st @ 2 pm ET Kevin Kelly once referred to the internet as a \"copying machine,\" noting that \"at its most foundational level, it copies every action, every character, every thought we make while we ride upon it.\"~\n",
      "This is an edition of The Miss is a feature in which we ask great investors to tell the story of a deal they misjudged. We unpack the biases that led to their decision and discuss the lessons learned. Venture capital can seem like a drab world sometimes.~\n",
      "This is Part II in a series on Audience and Wealth. Part I focused on the problems creators solve for consumers and the business models they use to build wealth. You can read it here. Today, we'll close the series by discussing the following subjects:~\n",
      "Erik Torenberg is hard to put in a box. When you think of him, what comes to mind first? His investments with Village Global? His time as an operator at Product Hunt? The Venture Stories podcast he hosts? Or the digital university he founded, On Deck?~\n",
      "In today&#8217;s analysis, we begin Part I of a series on Audience and Wealth. Over two issues we&#8217;ll cover the following topics: The problems creators solve for consumers The business models creators use to build wealth The roles creators, audience, and advertisers play~\n",
      "Brief: Banks are increasingly replaceable. \"Embedded finance\" makes it easy to deliver financial services in context. Over time, that may result in money gravitating towards influencer-run financial institutions. This could have significant ramifications for how society manages its surplus.~\n",
      "Welcome aboard. For those just joining us, In Flight exists to give readers the chance to try new tech, first. It also helps founders find their first true believers. Thanks for being here. Today, I'm excited to share Titles, a sports streaming app with a twist. Since launching a build a month or so ago, I've enjoyed playing with the app, and hearing about the team's vision for the future of fandom.~\n",
      "There are days where I can't stop thinking about Rasputin. This is the sort of uncomfortable habit that is hard to justify and marks me out as a genuine oddball. It is no less true. At a now-empty, somewhat cavernous Brooklyn Roasting coffee shop, I will find my mind drifting towards the shaggy holy man's penetrating gaze, wondering what he would be like to meet. On long walks, or falling asleep, he will appear for a moment, almost in passing, part of the furniture.~\n",

However, the impact of these changes has been limited by the online-offline gap &#8212; the fact that many clinical trial procedures still need to take place in-person. As we&#8217;ll get to, in-person visits are the single biggest reason why clinical trials are so slow and expensive. By taking them out of the equation, we&#8217;re able to truly leverage the scalability of digital technology and bring clinical trials into the digital age.~\n",
      "Clinical trials are the engine of healthcare, a process through which almost all new treatments go before being approved, adopted, and used by patients. Given their importance, even small improvements to the conduct of clinical trials can have significant implications for patient care. It&#8217;s unsurprising, therefore, that a large segment of digital health is focused on leveraging digital technology to improve clinical trials. Today, we&#8217;re going to take a look at what&#8217;s been done already and what&#8217;s to come.~\n",

There’s a common line about Google and Facebook that ‘if you’re not paying, you’re the product’, but this is pretty much what newspapers did: if you read old accounts for, say, the New York Times Company, you can see that they were giving the product away at close to cost and making the money from selling your attention. </p>\n",

We think of TV advertising as being pretty much unaffected by the internet so far, but on this data it’s down by 40% as a share of GDP.

      "<p class=\"\">It’s very common for people - especially newspaper people - to look at the newspaper and internet series in these charts and conclude that all the money went <em>from</em> newspapers to internet. There’s also a tendency to try to calculate Google and Facebook’s share of that ‘internet’ line. This can get you onto shaky ground quite quickly.  As that change in share of GDP (and my phase ‘suspiciously flat’) should suggest, what’s actually happened is that the market has been both reallocated and repriced, a lot of money left the data that’s being captured here, and a lot of other money came in. </p><p class=\"\">So: if you talk to people at both Google and Facebook and in the agency world, you’ll hear that perhaps two thirds to three quarters of money spent on Google and Facebook is money that was <em>never</em> spent on traditional advertising - it’s coming from SMEs and local businesses that <em>might</em> have spent in classified at most but probably wouldn’t have done even that. $60bn of consumer spending went through Shopify last year - it’s safe to assume those vendors spent money on advertising, but how many of them would have bought an ad in a local newspaper? This has also come at much lower prices: Facebook in particular has been massively deflationary to online advertising: it offers vast quantities of relevant advertising inventory at much lower prices and much lower entry costs than you’d have needed in print, let alone TV. </p><p class=\"\">Meanwhile, ‘advertising’ is only a subset of all the money being spent to ‘get people to buy things’, and the data captured in traditional metrics is only another subset, and money moves between those categories. This graphic made a couple of years ago (by an old colleague - Hi Omar!) captures some of that complexity. Some parts of this are called ‘advertising’ and others ‘marketing’, but that’s not always the best way to look at them.</p>\n",

      "<p class=\"\">If an estate agent shifts their budget from an insert in a local newspaper to their own website and to fees for Zillow or Rightmove, where does that appear in charts of ad spend? What if they close a branch and put the rent budget into Rightmove? Booking.com and Expedia between them spent $10bn on Google ads last year: did that money ‘come from’ newspaper advertising? Or from retail rents paid by travel agents? Wix.com now has $740m of ARR: that’s mostly doing the job of advertising and marketing, so did that money come from newspapers and magazines? Or from rent? Is that even a useful question? (And meanwhile Wix is often a top-ten advertiser itself in Europe.) I pay Squarespace and Mailchimp a fee for this site and for my <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter\">weekly newsletter</a>: 20 years ago I might have bought a listing in a professional directory, but is that really comparable? If Procter &amp; Gamble pays a supermarket for placement in the store, that’s categorised as ‘marketing’, but if it pays Amazon for placement in search results that’s categorised as ‘advertising’, and Amazon sold over $10bn of that placement last year.  So, what does a chart of ‘internet advertising’ really capture, and what is it missing, and what share, exactly, do Google and Facebook have? Are you sure?</p><p class=\"\">One of the most interesting charts I’ve seen on this theme comes from Google Trends. Like all Google Trends data it needs to be taken with a large pinch of salt, but this one is pretty instructive.  I’d suggest this shows the internet moving up the ‘funnel’ - it moves from utility price comparison to recommendation and authority. That might be a rather more profound conflict with traditional forms of media that those raw ad sales. </p>\n",

But it’s also because newspapers were an oligopoly, and they lose that oligopoly online. Newspapers are, yes, a content business, but they were also a light manufacturing business, and it was the replacement of light manufacturing and trucking with bits that removed the barrier to entry and unbundled their attention. So, here’s what <em>that</em> business looks like. In 2018, the US newspaper industry shipped ~2.5m tons of newspaper, down from 12.5m tons at its peak. </p>\n",

But Blackberry unit sales carried on rising for four years after the iPhone launch - in fact they went up 6x.  It took time for Apple to build the route to market and the software features that would let it take over in the enterprise, and time for the market to work that out.

      "<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat\">previous post on TikTok</a> I discussed why its For You Page algorithm is the connective tissue that makes TikTok work. It is the bus on its motherboard that connects and closes all its feedback loops.</p>\n",
      "<p>But in the breathless rush to understand why companies might want to acquire TikTok, should ByteDance be forced to divest itself of the popular short video app, the hype around its algorithm has taken on a bit of exoticization that often characterizes Western analysis of the Chinese tech scene these days.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-200\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-200\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">I kept holding off on publishing this piece because every day seemed to bring some new development in the possible ban of TikTok in the U.S. And instead of writing any introduction that would become instantly outdated, I'll just leave this sidenote here to say that as of publishing this entry, it seems Oracle will take over the TikTok cloud computing deal while also joining Wal-Mart and some VCs in assuming some ownership stake in TikTok Global. But it won't surprise me one bit if we find out even more bizarre details over the next week. This is the type of deal that I would have thought could only happen in Succession, but even in that satire it would seem hyperbolic. The 2020 Writer's Room is undefeated.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>In this post, I want to discuss exactly how the design of TikTok helps its algorithm work as well as it does. Last time I discussed why the FYP algorithm is at the heart of TikTok’s flywheel, but if the algorithm wasn’t effective then the whole feedback loop would collapse. Understanding how the algorithm achieves its accuracy matters even if you’re not interested in TikTok or the short video space because more and more, companies in all industries will be running up against a competitor whose advantage centers around a machine learning algorithm.</p>\n",
      "<p>What I want to discuss is how TikTok’s design helps its algorithm “see.”</p>\n",

      "<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FDQEsj\">Seeing Like a State</a> by James C. Scott is one of those books that turns you into one of those Silicon Valley types that use (abuse?) the term legibility. I first heard about it after reading Venkatesh Rao’s <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/\">summary of its main themes</a>, and that piece remains a good tldr primer on the book if you don’t plan to read the text (<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/\">Scott Alexander's review of the book</a> is also good though is long enough that it could almost justify its own tldr). However, I recommend that you do.</p>\n",
      "<p>The subtitle of Scott’s book is “How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.” In particular, Scott dissects a failure state that recurs across a number of domains, in which a governing body like the nation-state turns to what Scott terms high modernism in an effort to increase legibility of whatever it is they are trying to exert control over, whether for the purposes of taxation or conscription or any number of goals. In doing so, they impose a false sense of order on a reality more complex than they can imagine.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-160\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-160\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">It would really be fascinating to hear from Scott on the case of modern China, under CCP rule, with modern technology for surveillance, and whether he thinks they will prove or violate his thesis in the fullness of time.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>It’s a book that raises one’s awareness of all sorts of examples of unintended consequences in day-to-day life. We all could use a healthier does of humility when we are too flush with great man hubris. The world is richer and more complicated than we give it credit for. </p>\n",
      "<p>As an example, much of what Scott discusses has relevance to some of the hubris of our modern social networking giants. These dominant apps are designed to increase legibility of their user bases for, among other things, driving engagement, preventing churn, and ultimately, serving targeted advertisements. That, in turn, has led their parent companies into a thicket of problems which they’re grappling with constantly now.</p>\n",
      "<p>But that is a topic for another post, another day. Whereas Scott focuses in on how the nation-state uses simplifying abstractions to “see” its citizens at a synoptic level, I want to discuss how TikTok’s application design allows its algorithm to “see” all the detail it needs to perform its matchmaking job efficiently and accurately. If Seeing Like a State is about a common failure state, this post is about a new model for getting the most leverage from machine learning algorithms in the design of applications and services.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-150\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-150\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">I’m aware of the irony that the controversy around TikTok was the potential of user data being accessed by the CCP, or being “seen by that state.” Or that one of the sticking points of this new Cold War is the Chinese Firewall, which selects what the citizens of China “see.” And which most U.S. tech companies sit outside of, looking in.</span></p>\n",
      "<hr />\n",
      "<p>In recent years, one of the realizations in machine learning, at least to an outsider to the subject like myself, is just how much progress was possible just by increasing the volume of training data by several orders of magnitude. That is, even if the algorithms themselves aren’t that different than they were a few years ago, just by training them on a much larger datasets, AI researchers have achieved breakthroughs like <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/\">GPT-3</a> (which temporarily gave tech Twitter a tantric orgasm).</p>\n",
      "<p>When people say that TikTok’s algorithms are key to its success, many picture some magical block of code as being the secret sauce of the company. The contemporary postmodernist Russian writer Viktor Pelevin has said that the protagonist of all modern cinema is a briefcase full of money. From the briefcase of radioactive material (I think that’s what it was?) in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35NQsS8\">Kiss Me Deadly</a> to the briefcase of similarly glowing who knows what (Marcellus Wallace’s soul?) in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZN7IDr\">Pulp Fiction</a>, from the Genesis equation in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kzc2OJ\">The Formula</a> to the secret financial process in David Mamet’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35I0YKS\">The Spanish Prisoner</a>, we’ve long been obsessed in cinema with the magical McGuffin. In recent weeks, discussion of TikTok’s algorithm has elevated it into something similar, akin to one of those mystical archaeological artifacts in one of the Indiana Jones films, like the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, or the lingam Shivling.</p>\n",
      "<p>But most experts in the field doubt that TikTok has made some hitherto unknown advance in machine learning recommendations algorithms. In fact, most of them would say that TikTok is likely building off of the same standard approaches to the problem that others are.</p>\n",
      "<p>But recall that the effectiveness of a machine learning algorithm isn’t a function of the algorithm alone but of the algorithm after <em>trained on some dataset</em>. GPT-3 may not be novel, but trained on an enormous volume of data, and with a massive number of parameters, its output is often astonishing.</p>\n",
      "<p>Likewise, the TikTok FYP algorithm, trained on its dataset, is remarkably accurate and efficient at matching videos with those who will find them entertaining (and, just as importantly, at suppressing the distribution of videos to those who won’t find them entertaining).</p>\n",
      "<p>For some domains, like text, good training data is readily available in large volumes. For example, to train an AI model like GPT-3, you can turn to the vast corpus of text already available on the internet, in books, and so on. If you want to train a visual AI, you can turn to the vast supply of photos online and in various databases. The training is still <a href=\"https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/\">expensive</a>, but at least copious training data is readily at hand.</p>\n",
      "<p>But for TikTok (or Douyin, its Chinese clone), who needed an algorithm that would excel at recommending short videos to viewers, no such massive publicly available training dataset existed. Where could you find short videos of memes, kids dancing and lip synching, pets looking adorable, influencers pushing brands, soldiers running through obstacle courses, kids impersonating brands, and on and on? Even if you had such videos, where could you find comparable data on how the general population felt about such videos? Outside of Musical.ly’s dataset, which consisted mostly of teen girls in the U.S. lip synching to each other, such data didn’t exist.</p>\n",
      "<p>In a unique sort of chicken and egg problem, the very types of video that TikTok’s algorithm needed to train on weren’t easy to create without the app’s camera tools and filters, licensed music clips, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p>This, then, is the magic of the design of TikTok: it is a closed loop of feedback which inspires and enables the creation and viewing of videos on which its algorithm can be trained.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>For its algorithm to become as effective as it has, TikTok became its own source of training data</strong>.</p>\n",
      "<hr />\n",
      "<p>To understand how TikTok’s created such a potent flywheel of learning, we need to delve into its design.</p>\n",
      "<p>The dominant school of thought when it comes to UI design in tech, at least that I’ve grown up with the past two decades, has centered around removing friction for users in accomplishing whatever it is they’re trying to do while delighting them in the process. The goal has been design that is elegant, in every sense of the word: intuitive, ingenious, even stylish. </p>\n",
      "<p>Perhaps no company has more embodied this school of design than Apple. At its best, Apple makes hardware and software that is pleasingly elegant—“it just works”—but also sexy in a way that makes its users feel tasteful. <label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-100\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-100\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Apple’s infamous controlling style—no replaceable batteries for its phones and laptops, the current debate over its App Store rules—put the company squarely in the camp of what Scott in Seeing Like a State refers to as high modernism.</span> Is there any reason to show a video of how the new MacBook Pro body is crafted from one solid block of aluminum (besides the fact that Jony Ive cooing “a-loo-MIN-eee-um” is ASMR to Apple fans) when unveiling it at an Apple keynote? How about because it’s sexy AF to see industrial lasers carving that unibody out of a solid chunk of aluminum? And later, when you’re cranking out an email at a coffee shop on said laptop, some residual memory of that video in your unconscious will give you just the slightest hit of dopamine?</p>\n",
      "<p>There’s a reason this user-centric design model has been so dominant for so long, especially in consumer tech. First, it works. Apple’s market cap was, at last check, over 2 trillion dollars. <label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-101\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-101\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Remember when fake Sean Parker said a billion dollars was cool? That was just a decade ago and a billion dollars is no longer S-Tier. The wealth meta moves fast.</span> Furthermore, we live in the era of massive network effects, where tech giants who apply Ben Thompson’s <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/\">aggregation theory</a> and acquire a massive base of users can exert unbelievable leverage on the markets they participate in. One of the best ways to do that is to design products and services that do what users want better than your competitors.</p>\n",
      "<p>This school of design has been so dominant for so long that I’ve almost managed to forget some of the brutal software design that used to the norm in a bygone era.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-102\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-102\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Not to be confused with <a href=\"https://brutalistwebsites.com/\">brutalist design</a>, which can be quite beautiful in its own respect, like its <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/tokyos-intriguing-brutalist-architecture/\">architectural cousins</a>.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>But what if the key to serving your users best depends in large part upon training a machine learning algorithm? What if that ML algorithm needs a massive training dataset? In an age when machine learning is in its ascendancy, this is increasingly a critical design objective.</p>\n",
      "<p>More and more, when considering how to design an app, you have to consider how best to help an algorithm “see.” To serve your users best, first serve the algorithm.</p>\n",
      "<p>TikTok fascinates me because it is an example of a modern app whose design, whether by accident or, uhh, design, is optimized to feed its algorithm as much useful signal as possible. It is an exemplar of what I call <strong>algorithm-friendly design</strong>.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-170\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-170\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">I thought about calling it algorithm-centric design but felt it went too far. Ultimately, a design that helps an algorithm see is still doing so in service of providing the user with the best possible experience.</span> This might still be considered just a variant of user-centric design, but for those teams working on products with a heavy machine learning algorithm component, it may be useful to acknowledge explicitly. After all, when a product manager, designer, and engineer meet to design an app, the algorithm isn't in attendance. Yet its training needs must be represented.</p>\n",
      "<p>James Scott speaks of “seeing like a state,” of massive shifts in fields like urban design that made quantities like plots of land and their respective owners “legible” to tax collectors. TikTok’s design makes its videos, users, and user preferences legible to its For You Page algorithm. The app design fulfills one of its primary responsibilities: “seeing like an algorithm.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Let’s take a closer look. TikTok opens into the For You Page and goes right into a video. This is what it looks like. </p>\n",

      "<p>This design puts the user to an immediate question: how do you feel about this short video and this short video alone?</p>\n",
      "<p>Everything you do from the moment the video begins playing is signal as to your sentiment towards that video. Do you swipe up to the next video before it has even finished playing? An implicit (though borderline explicit) signal of disinterest. </p>\n",
      "<p>Did you watch it more than once, letting it loop a few times? Seems that something about it appealed to you. Did you share the video through the built-in share pane? Another strong indicator of positive sentiment. If you tap the bottom right spinning LP icon and watch more videos with that same soundtrack, that is additional signal as to your tastes. Often the music cue is synonymous with a meme, and now TikTok has another axis on which to recommend videos for you. Did you tap into the video creator’s profile page? Did you watch other videos of theirs, and did you then follow them? In addition to enjoying the video, perhaps you appreciate them in particular.</p>\n",
      "<p>But let’s step back even earlier, before you’re even watching the video, and understand how the TikTok algorithm “sees” the video itself. Before the video is even sent down to your phone by the FYP algorithm, some human on TikTok’s operations team has already watched the video and added lots of relevant tags or labels. </p>\n",
      "<p>Is the video about dancing? Lip synching? Video games? A kitten? A chipmunk? Is it comedic? Is the subject a male or female? What age, roughly? Is it a group video? Where is it set? What filters or visual effects are used? If there’s food involved, what kind? And so on. All of these labels become features that the algorithm can now see.</p>\n",
      "<p>Vision AI also does a pass on the video, and to the extent it can, contributes what it sees. Some of TikTok’s camera filters are designed to track human faces or hands or gestures so vision AI is often invoked even earlier, at the point of creation.</p>\n",
      "<p>The algorithm can also see what TikTok already knows about you. What types of videos have you enjoyed in the past? What demographic or psychographic information is known about you? Where are you watching the video? What type of device do you have? And so on. Beyond that, what other users are similar to you?</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's jump back to the moment you watch that video on your phone in TikTok. The FYP algorithm can now close all the feedback loops. It takes every one of the actions you take on the video and can guess how you, with all your tastes, feels about this video, with all its attributes.</p>\n",
      "<p>None of these individual steps sounds like rocket science, especially to anyone who works on any algorithmic social feed  today.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-110\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-110\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">In my previous piece I noted that TikTok doesn’t really have a strong social graph. One of the reasons the app is as effective as it is is that it doesn’t try to pretend to be what it isn’t. That is, people already have a gazillion other social graphs and ways to share with people they know. Rather than force people to do so within the TikTok app, they  make it dead simple to download videos or share them through those external channels. What TikTok keeps, however, is the signal that you chose to share that video. That data feeds their algorithm and their algorithm alone. Since the videos are watermarked, they also get a nice hit of free publicity from the share.</span> In fact, TikTok has published a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you\">blog post</a> describing essentially how their FYP algorithm works, and I doubt anyone in tech will find the description anything but obvious. </p>\n",
      "<p>But contrast what TikTok's FYP algorithm sees with what a comparable recommendation algorithm sees on most other social networking feeds.</p>\n",

      "<p>The default UI of our largest social networks today is the infinite vertically scrolling feed (I could have easily used a screenshot of Facebook above, for example). Instead of serving you one story at a time, these apps display multiple items on screen at once. As you scroll up and past many stories, the algorithm can’t “see” which story your eyes rest on. Even if it could, if the user doesn’t press any of the feedback buttons like the Like button, is their sentiment towards that story positive or negative? The signal of user sentiment isn’t clean.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you subscribe to the idea that UI's should remove friction, the infinite scrolling feed is ideal. It offers a sense of uninhibited control of the pace of consumption. The simulated physics that result from flicking a feed with your thumb and seeing it scroll up like the drum of the Big Wheel from the Price is Right Showcase Showdown with the exact rotational velocity implied by the speed of your initial gesture, seeing that software wheel gradually slow down exactly as it would if encountering constant physical friction, it’s one of the most delightful user interactions of the touchscreen era. You can scroll past a half dozen tweets or Facebook feed items in no time. Wheeeeeeee! </p>\n",
      "<p>A paginated design, in which you could only see one story at a time, where each flick of the finger would only advance the feed one item at a time, would be a literal and metaphoric drag.</p>\n",
      "<p>On the other hand, maybe you wouldn’t mind reading one tweet at a time if they were better targeted, and maybe they would be better targeted if Twitter knew more about which types of tweets really interest you. And maybe Twitter would know more about what really interested you if you had to give explicit and implicit positive or negative signals on every tweet.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even on a story a user does engage with, judging sentiment is a challenge. Most apps only have positive feedback mechanisms, most typically some form of a like button. Since apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are built around social graphs, it’s obvious why they might opt not to offer dislike buttons.</p>\n",
      "<p>But, as Stephen King wrote in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RGcXAb\">On Writing</a>, \"If you expect to succeed as a writer, rudeness should be the second-to-least of your concerns. The least of all should be polite society and what it expects. If you intend to write as truthfully as you can, your days as a member of polite society are numbered, anyway.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>By relying on a long scrolling feed with mostly explicit positive feedback mechanisms, social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have made a tradeoff in favor of lower friction scanning for users at the expense of a more accurate read on negative signal.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-170\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-170\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">You see another variant of this tradeoff at longstanding companies with the same founding CEO. That person tends to surround themselves with a C-Suite that follows their lead, works well with them. The danger of being surrounded by yes-men is not having anyone to challenge the blindspots in your thinking. It's always worth asking who the people are who are powerful enough to actually change the minds of people like Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, Musk. Often the answer is no one, so their blindspots become the blindspots of the company.<br /></span></p>\n",
      "<p>Networks that are built around interest graphs, like Reddit, do tend to incorporate down voting mechanisms because their prime directive to keep users from churning is to serve them the most interesting content. That means weeding out uninteresting content as much as it does surfacing appealing content.</p>\n",
      "<p>TikTok doesn’t have an explicit downvote button, but by serving you just one video at a time, they can infer your lack of interest in any single video based on whether you churn out of that video quickly <label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-103\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-103\" type=\"checkbox\" />\n",
      "<span class=\"sidenote\">A quick swipe up before a video has completed is like swiping left on Tinder. The best TikTokers have an intuitive sense of the narrative pace that is appropriate for that platform. How long can you drag out the punching or payoff without losing the viewer, how do you have a set up that keeps the user involved. Using a music cue that has already been co-opted into a meme helps because the bass drop or musical payoff foreshadows when the punchline of the video will drop; a viewer knows how much longer before they reach the payoff. Also viewers may stick around just for the pleasure of hearing that musical resolution.<br /></span> and by which positive actions you <em>don’t take</em>.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you click into a text post by someone on Facebook but don’t comment or like the post, how can Facebook judge your sentiment toward that post? Maybe you thought about disagreeing violently in comments, but the person is a coworker or friend of a friend and you decided the better of it. That negative sentiment is difficult to capture; the algorithm can’t “see” your feelings.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-104\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-104\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Most social networks have explicit reporting features for reporting offensive and/or abusive content, but those features are buried and most users don’t resort to them. By the time someone does use a feature like that, you’ve usually already made a grave mistake far upstream and it’s too late to salvage most of the damage that’s been done.<br /></span></p>\n",
      "<p>It’s the content that’s boring or causes mild displeasure that is the slow killer. In my previous post, I noted that content derived from a social graph can drift away from a user’s true interests because of the mismatch between your own interests and those of people you know. The switch from a chronological to algorithmic feed is often the default defensive move against such drift. </p>\n",
      "<p>But if the algorithm isn’t \"seeing\" signals of a user’s growing disinterest, if only positive engagement is visible, some amount of divergence is unavoidable. You might see that a user is slowly losing interest, not liking as many items, not opening your app as often, but precisely which stories are driving them away may be unclear. By the time they're starting to exhibit those signs of churn, it's often too late to reverse the bleeding.</p>\n",
      "<p>Algorithm-friendly design need not be user-hostile. It simply takes a different approach as to how to best serve the user’s interests. Pagination may insert some level of friction to the user, but in doing so, it may provide the algorithm with cleaner signal that safeguards the quality of the feed in the long run.</p>\n",
      "<p>Minimizing friction is merely one means to a great user experience. The goal of any design is not to minimize friction, it’s to help the user achieve some end. Reducing friction is often consistent with that end, but not always. You might say that the quote tweet reduces the friction of manually copying someone else’s tweet, but reducing friction to organizing a mob to pile on someone might not be a core mechanic you want to encourage if your goal is civil public discourse. Some forms of friction are good.</p>\n",
      "<p>You'll hear many power Twitter users counseling others to make use of muting and blocking early and often.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-120\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-120\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Some users even make liberal use of <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Soft%20Block\">soft blocking</a> to surreptitiously remove followers.<br /></span> Users proudly tweet screenshots of words they've muted as a sign of their displeasure with some popular topic of discussion (or their intellectual superiority to said topic). Non sports fans tweet about \"sportsball,\" others tweet \"I'll bite, what's X?\" where X is something everyone is discussing. Some people have gone so far as to unfollow everyone and start their following from scratch again.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-130\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-130\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">At some point, and likely because it A/B tested well, Twitter started showing users tweets that people they followed had liked, even from people that user didn't follow themselves. This does occasionally show me tweets of interest, but what it also does is increase, on an absolute basis, the number of tweets I have no interest in and have to scroll past. I'm a broken record on this: no two people have the exact same interests. The launch of this feature has me really considering unfollowing everyone and starting from scratch, but I also worry about hurting people's feelings, because I'm a softie. If Twitter were structured differently this wouldn't be an issue.<br /></span></p>\n",
      "<p>I sometimes think about adopting some or all of these strategies myself, but for Twitter, the necessity of these is itself a  failure of the service. If the algorithm were smarter about what interested you, it should take care of muting topics or blocking people on your behalf, without you having to do that work yourself. As I wrote last time, that you have to follow people at all on Twitter to get interesting content is, one could argue, a design flaw for what could be a powerful interest graph.</p>\n",
      "<p>Not only does TikTok capture very clean signals of sentiment from its users, it also gathers a tremendous volume of them per session. Videos on TikTok are so short that even in a brief session, TikTok can gather a lot of feedback on your tastes. </p>\n",
      "<p>The process is relatively painless, too. At worst, a few videos might bore you, but swiping them away makes for relatively painless work, and since the algorithm listens closely to your feedback, you may even enjoy dismissing videos knowing that the app will register your displeasure and act on it.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-180\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-180\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Short video happens to be a category quite suited to this type of machine learning-driven recommendation. By no means would I imply that it would work for every type of category. Music works well. It is short in duration so the sampling cost is low, and the repeat consumption value is high. Musical similarities tend to be mathematically detectable. My Spotify Radio recommendations are solid. On the other hand, algorithmic movie recommendations have never really felt magical to me. Movies are very long, the sampling cost is very high. The corpus is small, and only soemthing like 500 or so movies come out each year, of which most people only see a handful. This entire subject is worth a separate post.<br /></span></p>\n",
      "<p>By the way, TikTok isn’t the only app with an interface that is optimized for the task of matching, with an interface that shows you one entity at a time so as to be more clear on how you feel. Before TikTok, we had a whole category in which the one-item-at-a-time audition-style UI was dominant.</p>\n",

      "<p>There’s a reason swipe right and swipe left have become shorthand slang for signaling approval and disapproval, generally. Tinder came up with what feels like a design primitive on a touchscreen UI for binary voting.</p>\n",
      "<p>In this software era, true competitive advantages, or moats, are increasingly illusory. Most software features or UI designs can be copied easily by an incumbent or competitor overnight. All you will have done is test the impact of the design for them.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-105\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-105\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">On one of my trips to China, I was at a dinner with a large group of Chinese entrepreneurs, and I mentioned the hubbub over Instagram copying Stories from Snapchat. One of the chief product officers of one of China’s top companies laughed and remarked, “In China, if your competitor doesn’t copy one of your successful features inside of two weeks, they must be incompetent.” In many ways, the Chinese tech scene is the true Darwinian marketplace of ideas that Silicon Valley thinks of itself as. This bodes poorly for the relative output of Silicon Valley because the rate of idea spread and mutation occurs more quickly in China. Silicon Valley is often said to have taken over as the geographic center of technology innovation from Boston’s Route 128 in part because Silicon Valley’s more open labor markets allowed ideas to move freely among companies. China has taken that playbook and pushed it even further. Surviving the competitive landscape of the Chinese tech scene is like trying to climb out of that pit in The Dark Knight Rises. Terrifying.</span> </p>\n",
      "<p>But if you can create a flywheel, like TikTok’s, it becomes much harder for a competitor like Reels or Triller to catch up. Triller may pay some influencers from TikTok to come over and make videos there, Reels might try to draft off of existing Instagram traffic, but what makes TikTok work is the entire positive feedback loop connecting creators, videos, and viewers via the FYP algorithm.</p>\n",
      "<p>In tech, an industry that epitomizes Brian Arthur’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2REGqdO\">Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</a> perhaps more than any other, the first competitor to achieve product-market fit can run away from the pack. If more and more markets feel like they are winner-take-all, or winners-take-all, that is because in an increasingly interconnected world, they are.</p>\n",
      "<p>Bytedance is often described as the algorithm company, and TikTok has been described over the past few weeks as powered by just such algorithmic black magic. Many have gone so far as to say that TikTok wouldn’t be worth purchasing if the algorithm weren’t included.</p>\n",
      "<p>That’s a mistake, in my opinion. Yes, retraining the FYP recommendations algorithm might take so long that some users would churn. I don’t mean to trivialize that task. But the actual magic is how every element of TikTok's design and processes connect with each other to create a dataset with which the algorithm trains itself into peak performance. No single step in that loop is beyond the capabilities of any of the many U.S. suitors. All that’s needed is an understanding of how the flywheel works and a commitment to keep every element and process in it functioning.</p>\n",
      "<p>All around me, I encounter products or services that seem to have hit a ceiling in the quality of their algorithmic recommendations: Yelp, OpenTable, Amazon, Google, Netflix, and on and on. Don't get me wrong, some of them are at rest in a good place. But I can't help but feel there is another leap to be made in some of these, and that perhaps more algorithm-friendly design might be one of the possible solutions.</p>\n",
      "<p>To recap, in part one of my series on TikTok, I discussed how the algorithm acts as an matching mechanism that makes TikTok such a scalable entertainment network. In comparison, social networks have to approximate an interest graph using a social graph, with all the problems that come with that. In this second piece on TikTok, I’ve focused on how its design helps its machine learning FYP algorithm “see” what it needs to see to do its job so effectively. An algorithm-friendly design ethos may become a model of how other companies in other verticals might achieve an edge in the age of machine learning.</p>\n",
      "<p>But there’s one final reason I find TikTok such a fascinating and anomalous case study. It has to do less with software and algorithms and more with something that the cultural determinist in me will never tire of studying: the network effects of creativity. That will be the subject of my third and final part of this series on TikTok.</p>~\n",
      "<p>I often describe myself as a cultural determinist, more as a way to differentiate myself from people with other dominant worldviews, though I am not a strict adherent. It’s more that in many situations when people ascribe causal power to something other than culture, I’m immediately suspicious.</p>\n",
      "<p>The 2010’s were a fascinating time to follow the consumer tech industry in China. Though I left Hulu in 2011, I still kept in touch with a lot of the team from our satellite Hulu Beijing office, many of whom scattered out to various Chinese tech companies throughout the past decade. On my last visit to the Hulu Beijing office in 2011, I was skeptical any of the new tech companies out of China would ever crack the U.S. market. </p>\n",
      "<p>It wasn’t just that the U.S. had strong incumbents, or that the Chinese tech companies were still in their infancy. My default hypothesis was that what I call the veil of cultural ignorance was too impenetrable a barrier. That companies from non-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/33iA8aY\">WEIRD</a> countries (Joseph Henrich shorthand for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) would struggle to ship into WEIRD cultures. I was even skeptical of the reverse, of U.S. companies competing in China or India. The further the cultural distance between two countries, the more challenging it would be for companies in one to compete in the other. The path towards overcoming that seemed to lie in hiring a local leadership team, or sending someone over from the U.S. who understood the culture of that country inside-out.</p>\n",
      "<p>For the most part, that has held true. China has struggled, for the most part, to make real inroads in the U.S. WeChat tried to make inroads in the U.S. but only really managed to capture Chinese-Americans who used the app to communicate with friends, family, and business colleagues in China.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the other direction, the U.S. hasn’t made a huge dent in China. Obviously, the Great Firewall played a huge role in keeping a lot of U.S. companies out of the Chinese market, but in the few cases where a U.S. company got a crack at the Chinese market, like Uber China, the results were mixed.</p>\n",
      "<p>For this reason, I’ve been fascinated with TikTok. Here in 2020, TikTok is, for many, including myself, the most entertaining short video app going. The U.S. government is considering banning the app as a national security risk, and while that’s the topic du jour for just about everyone right now, I’m much more interested in tracing how it got a foothold in markets outside of China, especially the U.S. with its powerful incumbents.</p>\n",
      "<p>They say you learn the most from failure, and in the same way I learn the most about my mental models from the exceptions. How did an app designed by two guys in Shanghai managed to run circles around U.S. video apps from YouTube to Facebook to Instagram to Snapchat, becoming the most fertile source for meme origination, mutation, and dissemination in a culture so different from the one in which it was built?</p>\n",
      "<p>The answer, I believe, has significant implications for the future of cross-border tech competition, as well as for understanding how product developers achieve product-market-fit. The rise of TikTok updated my thinking. It turns out that in some categories, <strong>a machine learning algorithm significantly responsive and accurate can pierce the veil of cultural ignorance</strong>. Today, sometimes <strong>culture can be abstracted</strong>.</p>\n",
      "<hr />\n",
      "<p>TikTok's story begins in 2014, in Shanghai. Alex Zhu and Luyu “Louis” Yang had launched an educational short-form video app that hadn’t gotten any traction. They decided to pivot to lip-synch music videos, launching Musical.ly in the U.S. and China. Ironically, the app got more traction across the Pacific Ocean, so they killed their efforts in their home country of China and focused their efforts on their American market.</p>\n",
      "<p>The early user base consisted mostly of American teenage girls. Finally, an app offered users the chance to lip synch to the official version of popular songs and have those videos distributed to an audience for social feedback. </p>\n",
      "<p>That the app got any traction at all was progress. However, it presented Alex, Louis, and their team with a problem. American teen girls were not exactly an audience Alex and Louis really understood.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-1\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-1\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">To be fair, most American parents would argue they don't understand their teenage daughters either.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>During this era where China and the U.S. tech scenes have overlapped, the Chinese market has been largely impenetrable to the U.S. tech companies because of the Great Firewall, both the software instance and the outright bans from the CCP. But in the reverse direction, America has been almost as impenetrable to Chinese companies because of what might be thought of as America’s cultural firewall. Outside of DJI in drones<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-2\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-2\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">I'd argue one reason DJI had success in America was that drone control interfaces borrow heavily from standard flight control interfaces and are not culturally specific. Thus DJI could lean on its hardware prowess which was formidable.</span>, I can’t think of any Chinese app making real inroads in the U.S. prior to Musical.ly. To build on its early traction, Musical.ly would have to overcome this cultural barrier.</p>\n",
      "<p>It’s been said that if you ask your customers what they want, they’ll ask for a faster horse (attributed to Henry Ford, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast\">though that may not be true</a>). Frankly, that’s always been half horses***, and not just because horses are involved. First of all, what if your customers are horse jockeys?</p>\n",
      "<p>Secondly, while you can’t listen to your customers exclusively, paying attention to them is a dependable way to build a solid SaaS business, and even in the consumer space it provides useful signal. As I’ve written about before, customers may tell you they want a faster horse, and what you should hear is not that you should be injecting your horses with steroids but that your customers find their current mode of transportation, the aforementioned horse, to be too slow a means of getting around. </p>\n",
      "<p>Alex and Louis listened to Musical.ly’s early adopters. The app made feedback channels easy to find, and the American teenage girls using the app every day were more than willing to speak up about what they wanted to ease their video creation. They sent a ton of product requests, helping to inform a product roadmap for the Musical.ly team. That, combined with some clever growth hacks, like allowing watermarked videos to easily be downloaded and distributed via other networks like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, helped them achieve hockey-stick inflection among their target market.</p>\n",
      "<p>Still, Musical.ly ran into its <a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes\">invisible asymptote</a> eventually. There are only so many teenage girls in the U.S. When they saturated that market, usage and growth flatlined. It was then that a suitor they had rebuffed previously, the Chinese technology company Bytedance, suddenly looked more attractive, like Professor Bhaer to Jo March at the end of Little Women. In a bit of dramatic irony, Bytedance had cloned Musical.ly in China with an app called Douyin, one that had taken off in China, and now Bytedance was buying the app that inspired it, Musical.ly, an app conceived and built in China but that had failed in China and instead gotten traction in the U.S. </p>\n",

      "<p>After the purchase, Bytedance rebranded Musical.ly as TikTok. Still, if that’s all they had done, it’s not clear why the app would’ve broken out of its stalled growth to the stunning extent it has under its new owner. After all, Bytedance paid just $1B for an app that’s rumored to sell now, if the U.S. government approves the transaction, for anywhere from $30 to $70B.</p>\n",
      "<p>Bytedance did two things in particular to jumpstart TikTok’s growth. </p>\n",
      "<p>First, it opened up its wallet and started spending on user acquisition in the U.S. the way wealthy Chinese used to spend on American real estate (no, I’m not still bitter at all the Chinese all-cash offers that trounced me repeatedly when condo-hunting six years ago). TikTok was rumored to have been spending a staggering eight or nine figures a month on advertising. </p>\n",
      "<p>The ubiquity of TikTok ads lent the theory credence. I saw TikTok ads everywhere, on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and in mobile games<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-3\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-3\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">TikTok ads are bizarre. The video ads I see for the app in mobile games convey nothing about what the app is or does. One ad I've seen dozens of times has an old lady doing lunges in her living room, another has a kid blow drying his hair, and as he does, his hair changes colors. I feel like the ads could do a better job of selling the app, but what do I know?</span>. If Bytedance could have purchased ads on the back of my eyelids at sub $20 CPMs I don’t doubt they would have done so.</p>\n",
      "<p>It didn’t look like a wise investment at first. Rumors abounded that the 30-day retention of all those new users poured into the top of its funnel was sub 10%. They seemed to be lighting ad dollars on fire.</p>\n",
      "<p>Ultimately, the ROI on that spend would turn the corner, but only because of the second element of their assault on the US market, the most important piece of technology Bytedance introduced to TikTok: the updated For You Page feed algorithm.</p>\n",
      "<p>Bytedance has an absurd proportion of their software engineers focused on their algorithms, more than half at last check. It is known as the algorithm company, first for its breakout algorithmic “news” app Toutiao, then for its Musical.ly clone Douyin, and now for TikTok.</p>\n",
      "<p>Prior to TikTok, I would’ve said YouTube had the strongest exploit algorithm in video,<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-4\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-4\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">The exploit versus explore conundrum is sort of a classic of algorithmic design, usually mentioned in relation to the multi-armed bandit problem. For the purposes of this discussion, think of it simply as the problem of choosing which videos to show you. An exploit algorithm will give you more of what you like, while an explore algorithm tries to broaden your exposure to more than just what you’ve shown you like. YouTube is often described as an exploit algorithm because it tends to really push more of what you like, and then before you know it, you’re looking at some alt-right video that’s trying to redpill you.</span> but in comparison to TikTok, YouTube’s algorithm feels primitive (the top creators on YouTube have long ago figured out how to game YouTube’s algorithm’s heavy dependence on click-through rates and watch time, one reason so many YouTube videos are lengthening over time, much to my dismay).</p>\n",
      "<p>Before Bytedance bought Musical.ly and rebranded it TikTok, its Musical.ly clone called Douyin was already a sensation in the Chinese market thanks in large part to its effective algorithm. A few years ago, on a visit to Beijing, I caught up with a bunch of former colleagues from Hulu Beijing, and all of them showed me their Douyin feeds. They described the app as frighteningly addictive and the algorithm as eerily perceptive. More than one of them said they had to delete the app off their phone for months at a time because they were losing an hour or two every night just lying in bed watching videos.</p>\n",
      "<p>That same trip, I had coffee with an ex-Hulu developer who now was now a senior exec in the Bytedance engineering organization. Of course, he was tight-lipped about how their algorithm worked, but the scale of their infrastructure dedicated to their algorithms was clear. On my way in and out of this office, just one of several Bytedance spaces all across the city, I gawked at hundreds of workers sitting side by side in row after row in the open floorplan. It resembled what I’d seen at tech giants like Facebook in the U.S., but even denser.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-5\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-5\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">The mood was giddy. I could tell he was doing well. He took me and my friends to a Luckin Coffee in their office basement and told us to order drinks off an app on his phone. I reached in my pocket for some RMB to pay for the drinks and he put his hand on my arm to stop me. “Don’t worry, I can afford this,” he said, laughing. He didn’t mean it in a boasting manner, he seemed almost sheepish about how well they were doing. Afterwards, as we waited outside the office in their parking lot, he walked past and asked me if I needed a ride. No, I said, I’d be taking the subway. A Tesla Model X pulled up, the valet hopped out, and he jumped in and drove off.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>It’s rumored that Bytedance examines more features of videos than other companies. If you like a video featuring video game captures, that is noted. If you like videos featuring puppies, that is noted. Every Douyin feed I examined was distinctive. My friends all noted that after spending only a short amount of time in the app, it had locked onto their palate.</p>\n",
      "<p>That, more than anything else, was the critical upgrade Bytedance applied to Musical.ly to turn it into TikTok. Friends at Bytedance claimed, with some pride, that after they plugged Musical.ly, now TikTok, into Bytedance’s back-end algorithm, they doubled the time spent in the app. I was skeptical until I asked some friends who had some data on the before and after. The step change in the graph was anything but subtle.</p>\n",
      "<p>At the time Musical.ly got renamed TikTok, it was still dominated by teen girls doing lip synch videos. Many U.S. teens at the time described TikTok as “cringey,” usually a kiss of death for networks looking to expand among youths, fickle as they are about what’s cool. Scrolling the app at the time felt like eavesdropping on the theater kids clique from high school. Entertaining, but hardly a mainstream entertainment staple.</p>\n",
      "<p>That’s where the one-two combination of Bytedance’s enormous marketing spend and the power of TikTok’s algorithm came to the rescue. To help a network break out from its early adopter group, you need both to bring lots of new people/subcultures into the app—that’s where the massive marketing spend helps—but also ways to help these disparate groups to 1) find each other quickly and 2) branch off into their own spaces.</p>\n",
      "<p>More than any other feed algorithm I can recall, Bytedance’s short video algorithm fulfilled these two requirements. It is a rapid, hyper-efficient matchmaker. Merely by watching some videos, and without having to follow or friend anyone, you can quickly train TikTok on what you like. In the two sided entertainment network that is TikTok, the algorithm acts as a rapid, efficient market maker, connecting videos with the audiences they’re destined to delight. The algorithm allows this to happen <strong>without an explicit follower graph</strong>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Just as importantly, by personalizing everyone’s FYP feeds, TikTok helped to keep these distinct subcultures, with their different tastes, separated. One person’s cringe is another person’s pleasure, but figuring out which is which is no small feat.</p>\n",
      "<p>TikTok’s algorithm is the Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter universe. Just as that magical hat sorts students at Hogwarts into the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin houses, TikTok’s algorithm sorts its users into dozens and dozens of subcultures<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-6\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-6\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">The Sorting Hat is perhaps the most curious plot device from the Harry Potter universe. Is it a metaphor for genetic determinism? Did Draco have any hope of not being a Slytherin? By sorting Draco into that house, did it shape his destiny? Is the hat a metaphor for the U.S. college admissions system, with all its known biases? Is Harry Potter, sorted into Gryffindor, a legacy admit?</span>. Not two FYP feeds are alike. </p>\n",
      "<p>For all the naive and idealistic dreams of the so-called “marketplace of ideas,” the first generation of large social networks has proven mostly unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with the resulting culture wars. Until they have some real substantial ideas and incentives to take on the costly task of mediating between strangers who disagree with each other, they’re better off sorting those people apart. The only types of people who enjoy being thrown into a gladiatorial online arena together with those they disagree with seem to be trolls, who benefit asymmetrically from the resultant violence.</p>\n",
      "<p>Consider Twitter's content moderation problems. How much of that results from throwing liberals and conservatives together in a timeline together? Twitter employees speak often about wanting to improve public discourse, but they’d be much better off (and society, too) keeping the Slytherins and Gryffindors apart until they have some real substantive ideas to solve the problem of low trust conversation.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-7\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-7\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">The same can be said of NextDoor and their problem of racist reporting of minorities just walking down the sidewalk. They’d be better off just removing that feature. At some point, NextDoor needs to face the fact that they aren’t going to solve racism. Tweak that feature all you want, put up all the hoops for users to jump through to file such a report, but adverse selection ensures that those most motivated to jump through them are the racist ones.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>After some time, new subcultures did indeed emerge on TikTok. No longer was it just teenage girls lip-synching. There are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/style/elite-tiktok.html\">so many subcultures on TikTok</a> I can barely track them because I only ever see a portion of them in my personalized FYP. This broadened TikTok’s appeal and total addressable market. Douyin had followed that path in China, so Bytedance at least had some precedent for committing to such an expensive bet, but I wasn’t certain if it would work in the U.S., a much more competitive media and entertainment market.</p>\n",
      "<p>Within a larger social network, even subcultures need some minimum viable scale, and though Bytedance paid dearly to fill the top of the funnel, its algorithm eventually helped assemble many subcultures surpassing that minimum viable scale. More notably, it did so with amazing speed.</p>\n",
      "<p>Think of how most other social networks have scaled. The usual path is organic. Users are encouraged to follow and friend each other to assemble their own graph one connection at a time. The challenge with that is that it’s almost always a really slow build, and you have to provide some reason for people to hang around and build that graph, often encapsulated by the aphorism “<a href=\"https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network\">come for the tool, stay for the network</a>.” Today, it’s not as easy to build the “tool” part when so much of that landscape has already been mined and when scaled networks have learned to copy any tool achieving any level of traction.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-8\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-8\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">In the West, Facebook is the master of the fast follow. They struggle to launch new social graphs of their own invention, but if they spot any competing social network achieve any level of traction, they will lock down and ship a clone with blinding speed. Good artists borrow, great artists steal, the best artists steal the most quickly? Facebook as a competitor reminds me of that class of zombies in movies that stagger around drunk most of the time, but the moment they spot a target, they sprint at it like a pack of cheetahs. The type you see in 28 Days Later and I Am Legend. Terrifying.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>Some people still think that a new social network will be built around a new content format, but it’s almost impossible to think of a format that couldn’t be copied in two to three months by a compact Facebook team put in lockdown with catered dinners. Yes, a new content format might create a new proof of work, as I wrote about in <a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service\">Status as a Service</a>, but just as critical is building the right structures to distribute such content to the right audience to close the social feedback loop. </p>\n",
      "<p>What’s the last new social network to achieve scale in recent years? You probably can’t think of any, and that’s because there really aren’t any. Even Facebook hasn’t been able to launch any really new successful social products, and a lot of that is because they also seem fixated on building these things around some content format gimmick.</p>\n",
      "<p>Recall the three purposes which I used to distinguish among networks in Status as a Service: social capital (status), entertainment, and utility. In another post soon I promise to explain why I classify networks along these three axes, but for now, just know that while almost all networks serve some mix of the three, most lean heavily towards one of those three purposes.</p>\n",

      "<p>A network like Venmo or Uber, for example, is mostly about utility: I need to pay someone money, or I need to travel from here to there. A network like YouTube is more about entertainment. Amuse me. And some networks, what most people refer to when they use the generic term “social network,” are more focused on social capital. Soho House, for example.</p>\n",
      "<p>TikTok is less a pure social network, the type focused on social capital, than an entertainment network. I don’t socialize with people on TikTok, I barely know any of them. It consists of a network of people connected to each other, but they are connected for a distinct reason, for creators to reach viewers with their short videos.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-9\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-9\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Bytedance hasn't been successful in building out a social network to compete with WeChat, though it's not for lack of trying. I think they have a variety of options for doing so, but as with many companies that didn't begin as social first, it's not in their DNA. Facebook is underrated for its ability to build functional social plumbing at scale, that is a rare design skill. Companies as diverse as Amazon and Netflix have tried building social features and then later abandoned them. I suspect they tried when they didn't have enough users to create breakaway social scale, but it's difficult to imagine them pulling that off without more social DNA. But having a social-first DNA also means that Facebook isn't great at building non-social offerings. Their video or watch tab remains a bizarre and unfocused mess.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>One can debate the semantics of what constitutes a social network forever, but what matters here is realizing that another way to describe an entertainment network is as an interest network. TikTok takes content from one group of people and match it to other people who would enjoy that content. <strong>It is trying to figure out what hundreds of millions of viewers around the world are interested in</strong>. When you frame TikTok's algorithm that way, its enormous unrealized potential snaps into focus.</p>\n",
      "<p>The idea of using a social graph to build out an interest-based network has always been a sort of approximation, a hack. You follow some people in an app, and it serves you some subset of the content from those people under the assumption that you’ll find much of what they post of interest to you. It worked in college for Facebook because a bunch of hormonal college students are really interested in each other. It worked in Twitter, eventually, though it took a while. Twitter's unidirectional follow graph allowed people to pick and choose who to follow with more flexibility than Facebook's initial bi-directional friend model, but Twitter didn't provide enough feedback mechanisms early on to help train its users on what to tweet. The early days were filled with a lot of status updates of the variety people cite when criticizing social media: \"nobody cares what you ate for lunch.\"<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-10\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-10\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">I talk about Twitter's slow path to product market fit in <a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service\">Status as a Service</a></span></p>\n",
      "<p>But what if there was a way to build an interest graph for you without you having to follow anyone? What if you could skip the long and painstaking intermediate step of assembling a social graph and just jump directly to the interest graph? And what if that could be done really quickly and cheaply at scale, across millions of users? And what if the algorithm that pulled this off could also adjust to your evolving tastes in near real-time, without you having to actively tune it?</p>\n",
      "<p>The problem with approximating an interest graph with a social graph is that social graphs have negative network effects that kick in at scale. Take a social network like Twitter: the one-way follow graph structure is well-suited to interest graph construction, but the problem is that you’re rarely interested in everything from any single person you follow. You may enjoy Gruber’s thoughts on Apple but not his Yankees tweets. Or my tweets on tech but not on film. And so on. You can try to use Twitter Lists, or mute or block certain people or topics, but it’s all a big hassle that few have the energy or will to tackle.</p>\n",
      "<p>Think of what happened to Facebook when it’s users went from having their classmates as friends to hundreds and often thousands of people as friends, including coworkers, parents, and that random person you met at the open bar at a wedding reception and felt obligated to accept a friend request from even though their jokes didn’t seem as funny the next morning in the cold light of sobriety. Some have termed it context collapse, but by any name, it’s an annoyance everyone understands. It manifests itself in the declining visit and posting frequency on Facebook across many cohorts.</p>\n",
      "<p>Think of Snapchat’s struggles to differentiate between its utility— as a way to communicate among friends—and its entertainment function as a place famous people broadcast content to their fans. In a controversial redesign, Snapchat cleaved the broadcast content from influencers into the righthand Discover tab, leaving your conversations with friends in the left Chat pane. Look, the redesign seemed to say, Kylie Jenner is not your friend.</p>\n",
      "<p>TikTok doesn’t bump into the negative network effects of using a social graph at scale because it doesn't really have one. It is more of a pure interest graph, one derived from its short video content, and the beauty is its algorithm is so efficient that its interest graph can be assembled without imposing much of a burden on the user at all. It is passive personalization, learning through consumption. Because the videos are so short, the volume of training data a user provides per unit of time is high. Because the videos are entertaining, this training process feels effortless, even enjoyable, for the user.</p>\n",
      "<p>I like to say that “<strong>when you gaze into TikTok, TikTok gazes into you</strong>.” Think of all the countless hours product managers, designers and engineers have dedicated to growth-hacking social onboarding—goading people into adding friends and following people, urging them to grant access to their phone contact lists—all in an attempt to carry them past the dead zone to the minimum viable graph size necessary to provide them with a healthy, robust feed. (sidenote: Every social product manager has heard the story of Facebook and Twitter’s keystone metrics for minimum viable friend or follow graph size countless times.) Think of how many damn interest bubble UI’s you’ve had to sit through before you could start using some new social product: what subjects interest you? who are your favorite musicians? what types of movies do you enjoy?<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-11\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-11\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">The last time I tried to use Twitter’s new user onboarding flow, it recommended I follow, among other accounts, that of Donald Trump. There are countless ways they could onboard people more efficiently to provide them with a great experience immediately, but that is not one of them.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>TikTok came along and bypassed all of that. In a two-sided entertainment marketplace, they provide creators on one side with unmatched video creation tools coupled with potential super-scaled distribution, and viewers on the other side with an endless stream of entertainment that gets more personalized with time. In doing so, TikTok, with a product team and infrastructure mostly located in China, came out of left field and became a player in the attention marketplace on the same playing fields around the world as giants like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and Netflix. Not quite a Cinderella story...maybe a Mulan story?</p>\n",
      "<p>TikTok didn't just break out in America. It became unbelievably popular in India and in the Middle East, more countries whose cultures and language were foreign to the Chinese Bytedance product teams. Imagine an algorithm so clever it enables its builders to treat another market and culture as a complete black box. What do people in that country like? No, even better, what does each individual person in each of those foreign countries like? You don't have to figure it out. The algorithm will handle that. The algorithm knows.</p>\n",
      "<p>I don’t think the Chinese product teams I’ve met in recent years in China are much further ahead than the ones I met in 2011 when it comes to understanding foreign cultures like America. But what the Bytedance algorithm did was it abstracted that problem away.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-12\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-12\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">One of the concerns about CCP ties with Bytedance is that they might use it as a propaganda tool against the U.S. I tend to think that problem is overrated because my sense is that many in China still don't understand the nuances of American culture, just as America doesn't understand theirs (though I speak Mandarin, some of the memes on Douyin fly way over my head). However, perhaps an algorithm that abstracts culture into a series of stimuli responses makes it more dangerous?</span></p>\n",
      "<p>Now imagine that level of hyper efficient interest matching applied to other opportunities and markets. Personalized TV of the future? Check. Education? I already find a lot of education videos in my TikTok feed, on everything from cooking to magic to iPhone hacks. Scale that up and Alex and Louis might finally realize their dream of a short video education app that they set out to build before Musical.ly. </p>\n",
      "<p>Shopping? A slam dunk, Douyin and Toutiao already enable a ton of commerce in China. Job marketplace? A bit of a stretch, but not impossible. If Microsoft buys TikTok, I’d certainly give the TikTok team a crack at improving my LinkedIn feed, which, to be clear, is horrifying. What about personalized reading, from books to newsletters to blogs? Music? Podcasts? Yes, yes, yes please. Dating? The world could absolutely use an alternative to the high GINI co-efficient, high inequality dating marketplace that is Tinder. </p>\n",
      "<p>Douyin already visualizes much of this future for us with its much broader diversity of videos and revenue models. In China, video e-commerce is light years ahead of where it is in the U.S. (for a variety of reasons, but none that aren’t surmountable; a topic, again, for another piece). Whereas TikTok can still feel, to me, like a pure entertainment time-killer, Douyin, which I track on a separate phone I keep just to run Chinese apps for research purposes, feels like much more than that. It feels like a realization of short video as a broad use case platform.</p>\n",
      "<p>There’s a reason that many people in the U.S. today describe social media as work. And why many, like me, have come to find TikTok a much more fun app to spend time in. Apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are built on social graphs, and as such, they amplify the scale, ubiquity, and reach of our performative social burden. They struggle to separate their social functions from their entertainment and utility functions, injecting an aspect of social artifice where it never used to exist.</p>\n",
      "<p>Facebook has struggled with its transition to utility, which would’ve offered it a path towards becoming more of a societal operating system the way WeChat is in China. To be fair, the competition for many of those functions is much stiffer in the U.S. In payments, for example, Facebook must compete with credit cards, which work fine and which most people default to in the U.S., whereas in China AliPay and WeChat Pay were competing with a cash-dominant culture. Still, in the U.S., Facebook has yet to make any real inroads in significant utility use cases like commerce.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-13\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-13\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">I speak so often about how much video as a medium is underrated by tech elites. In an alternate history of Facebook, they would've made a harder shift to becoming a video-only app, moving up the ladder from text to photos to videos, and maybe they would've become TikTok before TikTok. If they had, I think their time spent figures would be even higher today. For as quickly as Facebook moved to disrupt itself in the past, there's a limit to how far they're willing to go. I plan to compare the Chinese and U.S. tech ecosystems in a future post, and one of the broadest and most important takeaways is that China leapfrogged the U.S. in the shift to video, among many other things. This doesn't mean the U.S. won't then leapfrog China the next time around, but for now, the U.S. is the trailing frog in several categories.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>Instagram is some strange hybrid mix of social and interest graph, and now it’s also a jumble of formats, with a Stories feed relegated to a top bar in the app while the more stagnant and less active original feed continues to run vertically as the default. Messaging is pushed to a separate pane and also served by a separate app. Longer form videos bounce you to Instagram TV, which is just an app for videos that exceed some time limit, I guess? And soon, perhaps commerce will be jammed in somehow? Meanwhile, they have a Discover tab, or whatever it is called, which seems like it could be the default tab if they wanted to take a more interest-based approach like TikTok. But they seem to have punted on making any hard decisions for so long now that the app is just a Frankenstein of feeds and formats and functions spread across a somewhat confused constellation of apps.</p>\n",
      "<p>Twitter has never seemed to know what it is. Ask ten different Twitter employees, you’ll hear ten different answers. Perhaps that’s why the dominant product philosophy of the company seems to be a sort of constant paralysis broken up by the occasional crisis mitigation. One reason I’ve long wished Twitter had just become a open protocol and let the developer community go to town is that Twitter moves. At. A. Snail's. Pace.</p>\n",
      "<p>The shame of it is that Twitter had a head start on an interest graph, largely through the work of its users, who gave signal on what they cared about through the graphs they assembled. That could have been a foundation to all sorts of new markets for them. They could’ve even been an interest-based social network, but instead users have mostly extracted that value themselves by pinging each other through the woefully neglected DM product.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-14\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-14\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Of course, Twitter also once purchased Vine and then let it wither on the, uh vine. Of all the tech companies that could purchase TikTok, maybe Twitter is the one that least deserves it. At a minimum, they should be required to submit a book report showing they understand what it is they're buying.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>A few other tech companies are worth mentioning here. YouTube is a massive video network, but honestly they may have shipped even less than Twitter over the years. That they don’t have any video creation tools of note (do they have any?!) and allowed TikTok to come in and steal the short video space is both shocking and not.</p>\n",
      "<p>Amazon launched a short video commerce app some time ago. It came and went so quickly I didn’t even have time to try it. Though Amazon is good at many things, they just don’t have the DNA to build something like TikTok. That they have failed to realize the short video commerce vision that China led the way on is a shocking miss on their part.</p>\n",
      "<p>Apple owns the actual camera that so many of these videos are shot on, but they've never understood social.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-15\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-15\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">iMessages could be a social networking colossus if Apple had the social DNA, but every day other messaging apps pull further away in functionality and design. But I guess they're finally adding threading in iMessages with the next iOS release? Haha.</span> At least they'll continue to improve the camera hardware with every successive iPhone release. </p>\n",
      "<p>None of this is to say TikTok is anywhere near the market value of any of these aforementioned American tech giants. If you still think of it as a novelty meme short video app, you're not far from the truth.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-16\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-16\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Are there flaws with TikTok? Of course. It’s far from perfect. The algorithm can be too clingy. Sometimes I like one video from some meme and the next day TikTok serves me too many follow-up videos from the same meme. But the great thing about a hyper-responsive algorithm is that you can tune it quickly, almost like priming GPT-3 to get the results you want. Often all it takes to inject some new subculture into your TikTok feed is to find some video from it (you can easily find them on YouTube or via friends whose feeds are different from your own) and like it. Another problem for TikTok is that a lot of other use cases are being jammed into what was designed to be a portrait mode lip synch video app. Vertical video is good for the human figure, for dance and makeup videos, but not ideal for other types of communication and storytelling (I still hate when basketball and football highlight clips can’t show more of the horizontal playing field, and that goes for both IG and TikTok; in many highlights of Steph Curry hitting a long 3 you can’t see him, or the basket, only one of the two, lol).</span> Stepping up a level, the list of opportunities Bytedance and TikTok have yet to capitalize on in the U.S. is long, and it wouldn’t surprise me if they miss many of them even if they stave off a ban from the U.S. government. Much of it would require new form factors, and it’s unclear how strong the TikTok product team would be, especially if divested out of Bytedance. Under Microsoft, a company with a fairly shaky history in the consumer market, it's unclear that their full potential would be realized.</p>\n",
      "<p>Still, none of that product work is rocket science. Much of it seems clear in my head. More importantly, TikTok, if armed with the Bytedance algorithm as part of a divestment, has a generalized interest-matching algorithm that can allow it to tackle U.S. tech giants not head on but from an oblique angle. To see it as merely a novelty meme video app for kids is to miss what its much greater disruptive potential. That an app launched out of China could come to the U.S. and sprint into cultural relevance in this attention marketplace should be a wake-up call to complacent U.S. tech companies. Given how many of those companies rely on intuiting user interests to sell them things or to show them ads, a company like TikTok which found a shortcut to assembling such an interest graph should raise all sorts of alarm bells.</p>\n",
      "<p>It surprises me that more U.S. tech companies aren’t taking a harder run at trying to acquire TikTok if the rumored CFIUS hammer stops short of an outright ban. I can’t think of any of them that shouldn’t be bidding for what is a once-in-a-generation forced fire sale asset. I’ve seen prices like $30B tossed around online. If that’s true, it’s an absolute bargain. I’d easily pay twice that without a second thought.</p>\n",
      "<p>I could cycle through my long list of nits, but ultimately they are all easily solvable with the right product vision and execution. TikTok has figured out the hardest piece, the algorithm. With it, a massive team made up mostly by people who’ve never left China, and many who never will, grabbed massive marketshare in cultures and markets they’d never experienced firsthand. To a cultural determinist like myself, that feels like black magic.</p>\n",
      "<hr />\n",
      "<p>On that same trip to China in 2018 when I visited Bytedance, an ex-colleague of mine from Hulu organized a visit for me to <a href=\"https://www.newsdogapp.com/en/\">Newsdog</a>. It was a news app for the Indian market built by a startup headquartered in Beijing. As I exited the elevator into their lobby, I was greeted by a giant mural of Jeff Bezos’ famous saying “It’s Always Day One” on the opposite wall. </p>\n",
      "<p>A friend of a friend was the CEO there, and he sat me down in a conference room to walk me through their app. They had raised $50M from Tencent just a few months earlier that year, and they were the number one news app in India at the time.</p>\n",
      "<p>He opened the app on his phone and handed it to me. Similar to Toutiao in China, there were different topic areas in a scrollbar across the top, with a vertical feed of stories beneath each. All of these were stories selected algorithmically, as is the style of Toutiao and so many apps in China.</p>\n",
      "<p>I looked through the stories, all in Hindi (and yes, one feed that contained the thirst trap photos of attractive Indian girls in rather suggestive outfits standing under things like waterfalls; some parts of culture are universal). Then I looked up from the app and through the glass walls of the conference room at an office filled with about 40 Chinese engineers, mostly male, tapping away on their computers. Then I looked back down at page after page of Hindi stories in the app.</p>\n",
      "<p>“Wait,” I asked. “Do you have people in this office or at the company who know how to read Hindi?”</p>\n",

Luxury goods like Birkin bags are often cited as examples of these exceptional goods that violate the conventional relationship between price and demand.</p>\n",

      "<p>Perhaps trolling is just a condition in which there are asymmetric emotional costs to engaging in a debate.

      "<p>I hadn’t planned on seeing <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Z1AGh2\">John Wick 3 - Parabellum</a>, but out for a walk in Stockholm in May, I got caught in a sudden downpour without an umbrella. I was in Sweden for the first time thanks to an invitation from the Spotify product team and had decided to spend some of my downtime seeing the city. <label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-demo\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-demo\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Sweden, by the way, is the country with the <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/nicolas-cole/the-second-largest-unicorn-breeding-ground-in-the-world-sweden.html\">second highest unicorns per capita</a>. Fascinating, and a topic for another day.</span> I sprinted out of the rain and into the nearest building, which happened to be a movie theater. Checking <a href=\"https://darksky.net/app\">Dark Sky</a> on my phone, the rain didn’t look to let up for another hour or two, so I scanned the theater listings and found a film in English. John Wick 3: Parabellum it was. </p>\n",
      "<p>Like many I enjoyed the first John Wick movie for its lean and elegant plot and balletic fight choreography. Keanu Reeves was inspired casting given his unfussy acting style. However, I thought the sequel was unnecessary. I wasn’t expecting much from yet another entry, the third, but I rarely regret spending two hours in a darkened theater. Watching an American film in the company of a Swedish audience also promised to be a form of cultural field work, and on that front, I felt fortunate the house was packed with locals.</p>\n",
      "<p>John Wick 3 - Parabellum begins directly after the events of the previous film, and at first, all seemed familiar. But after having spent two films worth of time in this universe already, sometime midway through the third film, it dawned on me. The rules of this film franchise mapped with uncanny precision to something that everyone had been complaining about to me for years now: cancel culture.</p>\n",
      "<p>With that, the films took on heightened resonance. Here I present my theory of John Wick Universe as an allegory of cancel culture.</p>\n",
      "<p>[SPOILER ALERT: Here is where I must warn people who haven’t seen the films that I will reveal key plot points to the three Wick films below. I don’t feel like the charms of this film series lie in the plot details—what happens isn’t surprising in the least to even the most casual of action film fans—but I disagree with those who say spoiler culture has ruined film criticism. Instead I’m happy to let my readers choose their own acceptable quota of narrative novelty. If you prefer not to learn the plots of the John Wick films, stop reading here.]</p>\n",
      "<p>Wick’s character motivation can be described thus: my name is John Wick. You stole my car. You killed my dog. Prepare to die.</p>\n",
      "<p>Reeves plays Wick from cinema’s storied tradition of zen-like hit men, almost placid in their mastery of their craft, which, in his case, is the violent dispatch of other humans from the realm of the living. This is Alain Delon in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QwTrGA\">Le Samourai</a>, Robert De Niro in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2sYiyZV\">Heat</a>, Jean Reno as Victor \"The Cleaner\" in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FvMuzi\">La Femme Nikita</a>. Less sexual than Bond, not quite as overtly cruel as Matz and Jacamon’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30Ytymz\">Killer</a>. These hit men have a heart, but their highest order bit is the code by which they live. Whether personal or business, there's little difference, the job is killing.</p>\n",
      "<p>And kill he does. In John Wick 3: Parabellum the signature choreography of death remains, a style which can only be described as baroque. Not John Wick for a single gunshot to the head when he can first maim with a few amuse bouche bullets to the torso and limbs. Why engage in a simple fist fight when one can hold a confrontation in a store filled with display cases lined with all manner of knives (in case of emergency, break glass with the skull of your combatant). Why simply perforate assailants with automatic weapons when they can be simultaneously be relieved of their genitals by an attack dog?<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-demo\"></label></p>\n",
      "<p><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-demo\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\"> It wasn’t until Michael Bay’s terrible <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81001887\">6 Underground</a> on Netflix that I saw a film with more cartoonish violence this year.</span></p>\n",
      "<p>For some, this is entertainment enough. I’ll never hesitate to offer my opinions on any piece of entertainment, but I do not begrudge anyone their pleasures. Certainly, the crowd of Swedes who laughed and cheered at the escalating violence seemed more than entertained. For me, however, films are even more compelling when they speak to the world outside the edges of the screen. I'm nothing if not a sucker for subtext. What fascinated me about John Wick was how its absurdist universe acted as a wry commentary on cancel culture.</p>\n",
      "<p>Do I think this subtext was intentional? Doubtful. Some filmmakers reward subtextual readings more than others. Still, the advantage of making a film with such a lean universe design is its semiotic flexibility.</p>\n",
      "<p>John Wick’s real name, we learn, is Jardani Jovonovich, a Belarussian gypsy raised as an assassin. Wick is nicknamed Baba Yaga, the Boogeyman, for he is the master of assassination. Who are most gifted in using social media to sow chaos and division in the world, especially the United States, than the Russians? Having lost the Cold War they’ve come back in a more fluid and confounding form.</p>\n",
      "<p>When the first film begins, Wick has left that world of violence behind for a peaceful domestic life with his wife Helen. But she dies from an illness, though not before leaving him a beagle to keep him company. The dog, along with Wick’s car, a 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, are recognizable to anyone as the two iconic totems of an American’s most sacred values.</p>\n",
      "<p>When a group of Russian gangsters try to buy his car and Wick refuses, they break into his home, steal the car, and kill the dog. In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2sKmJZy\">Pulp Fiction</a>, John Travolta complains to Eric Stoltz that some vandals keyed his car. Stoltz commiserates. </p>\n",
      "<blockquote>\n",
      "<p>“They should be fuckin’ killed, man. No trial, no jury, straight to execution,” he says.</p>\n",
      "<p>“What’s more chicken-shit than fuckin’ with a man’s automobile?” says Travolta. “Don’t fuck with another man’s vehicle.”</p>\n",
      "<p>“You don’t do it,” agrees Stoltz. </p>\n",
      "</blockquote>\n",
      "<p><br />\n",
      "In America, the car is the symbol of a man’s property and an expression of his individual freedom. The dog is the symbol of unconditional loyalty, man’s faithful companion as he rules over his domain.</p>\n",

      "<p>In a social media context, we can think of Wick’s dog and his car as representing those beliefs we hold sacred. When Wick loses his car and his dog, he is every one of us who sees one of the values we consider intrinsic to our personal identity impugned by some stranger on social media. That the perpetrators are Russian is nothing if not reminiscent of Russian agents sowing discord in American society in the run up to the 2016 Presidential election.</p>\n",
      "<p>It turns out John used to work for the father of the leader of the gangsters who stole his car and killed his dog. That father, Viggo, upon learning what his son Iosef has done, calls Wick and begs him to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk\">let it go</a>. Don’t feed the trolls, we are told time and again. But we, like Wick, cannot. His permanent sabbatical from assassination has come to an end.</p>\n",
      "<p>As on social media, violence begets violence. Since Wick refuses to let the matter go, Viggo, to protect his son, sends a preemptive hit squad to assassinate Wick at his home. We never fight a single target on social media because the public broadcast nature of social media always rallies others to the cause. The first John Wick film proceeds from there as a series of attacks and counterattacks until Wick emerges, alive, bloodied, with a new dog, a pit bull he frees from an animal clinic. Viggo, Iosef, and what seems like a hundred or so henchmen are dead. The new dog symbolizes a brief moment of peace for Wick, just as we sometimes emerge from our skirmishes online feeling as if we have the moral high ground, our honor once again intact.</p>\n",
      "<p>John Wick 2 begins with him retrieving his car from a chop shop owned by Viggo's brother, which requires Wick to kill not only Viggo’s brother but his fellow goons. The car takes serious damage in the firefight, much like the beating we take defending ourselves online, but Wick eventually emerges with his car and new dog and then returns home to bury his weapons cache. He thinks he is out of the game once again.</p>\n",
      "<p>As anyone who has participated in culture wars knows, any victory is temporary and pyrrhic. </p>\n",
      "<p>Out of the blue, Santino D’Antonio visits Wick at his home and calls in a marker, represented in the films by a medallion with a drop of blood from the debtor. Santino needs Wick to become an assassin again, just as various friends online call on us to take their side in various online battles.</p>\n",
      "<p>John refuses. He wants out. The marker is the marker, though. If you won’t defend your values, then can you say you really have any? Santino reminds John of this in a not-so-subtle way: he blows up Wick’s house with a grenade launcher.</p>\n",
      "<p>This brings us to The Continental, the unique hotel chain at the heart of the John Wick universe. Their Manhattan branch is run by Winston (Ian McShane) and staffed by the always courteous and professional concierge Charon (Lance Reddick). Now homeless, Wick retreats to the Continental for refuge. The entire Continental hotel chain lives under the aegis of the High Table, like one of the W Hotels in the former Starwood and now Marriott network. </p>\n",
      "<p>The Continental hotel chain stands in for our social media platforms. Like them, The Continental claims neutrality—no killing is allowed on Continental grounds—yet they happily arm assassins with all manners of weapons, like Twitter arming people with the quote tweet, the AK-47 of social media. They even employ a weapons sommelier. </p>\n",
      "<p>The Continental sets all sorts of very specific policies that seem to be in conflict with each other; do they want civility or violence? Visitors to the Continental, like Wick, vacillate between wanting them to enforce rules and wondering who put them in charge in the first place. In other words, a mirror of the tension between users and the social networks that dominate the modern internet.</p>\n",
      "<p>At any rate, Winston reminds Wick he must honor the marker from Santino, because them’s the rules. These markers are like metaphors for engagement, the debt we pay social networks for the privilege of their services and distribution. Social media platforms do not want violence on their grounds, yet they live through user engagement. The only way to not have any markers on your ledger is to never accrue a debt in the first place, but Wick was raised in the golden age of social networks, where it was near impossible to avoid being active on them. Bowing to the marker, Wick accedes to Santino’s request to assassinate his sister so Santino can assume her spot on the High Table council.</p>\n",
      "<p>Wick carries out the mission, with great reluctance, only to have Santino turn around and put a $7 million contract on Wick for murdering his sister. This is akin to battling your enemies on social media platforms, creating the engagement that platforms thrive off of, only to have them turn around and lock your account for having done so. Many a person I know has complained about just such a betrayal. Pour one out for David Simon and his periodic bans on Twitter for eviscerating his opponents in a blaze of profanity. </p>\n",
      "<p>Wick, as is his style, comes after Santino, who retreats to the safety of the Continental, where no violence is allowed. But Wick has been betrayed, and personal values now take precedence over the platform rules of The Continental. He pursues Santino onto hotel grounds and guns him down in front of Winston. </p>\n",
      "<p>As penalty for conducting assassin business on Continental grounds, the High Table doubles the bounty on Wick to $14 million and broadcasts it globally. As the second film ends, Winston informs Wick of the bounty and gives him an hour head start to run. He sets off with his pit bull through Central Park as cell phones start ringing throughout the park. Wick has been true to his beliefs, as symbolized by the dog by his side, but the outrage mob is about to be set loose on him.</p>\n",
      "<p>John Wick 3: Parabellum picks up from there. Wick is on the run through the rain of Manhattan, glancing at his watch as the seconds tick down to the global bounty becoming official.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the Wick universe, official High Table business is processed through a central office by dozens of men and women dressed like old school phone switch operators, all of whom go about their jobs with an almost cheerful professionalism. Anyone who has ever received an impassive automatic reply from a social media customer service department after reporting some vicious attack can empathize with the almost comical formality of the Kafkaesque institution in the face of what feels like emotional terrorism.</p>\n",
      "<p>That the bounty is put out by the High Table feels appropriate. It’s because of the algorithmic distribution of social media platforms that the asymmetric attack of the bloodthirsty mob achieves modern levels of scale and precision. The High Table seems elusive, at times arbitrary, just like the moderation policies of social networks. Winston at time seems friendly to John, yet he also stands by as the mob prepares to set upon Wick. Many users of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and so on can relate to this love-hate relationship with those platforms.</p>\n",
      "<p>As soon as Wick’s bounty goes global, seemingly every next person on the street comes sets upon him with the nearest weapon at hand. Anyone who has been attacked by an online mob, or even mildly harassed, is familiar with this uniquely modern sensation of being set upon by complete strangers. The Wick films give online mobs physical form. These random assassins are the Twitter eggs with usernames like pepe298174.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even more perfect, strangers attack John Wick only after glancing at their phones and receiving word of the bounty. How do outrage mobs coalesce in the online world? From people staring at social media on their phones and locating the next target to be cancelled. The High Table’s bounty system, with its mobile notifications, is nothing less than a formalization of the mechanisms by which social networks enable cancel culture. </p>\n",

      "<p>Wick dispatches one attacker after the other with every weapon at hand, whether axe or handgun or, in the first case, a hardcover book (when you absolutely, positively, have to snap a man’s neck using a book lodged in his jaw, a flimsy paperback or e-book just will not do).</p><p>I’ve talked to liberals who’ve been set upon by the alt-right. Women who’ve been attacked by gamers. Creatives who are set upon by outraged fans. Conservatives who feel swarmed by SJW’s. Everyone feels unjustly attacked by faceless mobs, everyone is aggrieved. Everyone feels they are standing up for their truth and their principles, like John Wick, while mindless strangers attack from all sides. John Wick is the avatar of the modern social media user, the \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvAhRcUofDk\">righteous man beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men</a>.\"</p><p>Just before the bounty goes live, Wick stops by one of those doctors in the movies that caters to assassins and mobsters, the ones with fantastic service, always willing to provide bullet removal surgery on demand to walk-ins. Wick is bleeding from a shoulder wound inflicted by an overzealous assassin who tried to take John out before the bounty went official. Wick begs the doctor to patch him up, and he does, even pointing John to some medicine for the pain. But before Wick leaves, the doctor asks John to shoot him twice, to make it seem as if Wick coerced him into helping him. The doctor knows it is near impossible to stay neutral in the culture wars; if you’re not on one side you’re on the other. Ask Maggie Haberman.</p><p>John calls in a marker from a woman known as the Director (Anjelica Huston). She runs a ballet theater called the Ruska Roma that doubles as some sort of training ground for assassins; it’s implied that Wick learned his trade there. Once again, the blind loyalty to this marker system perpetuates a cycle of violence. Huston would rather not be involved, admonishing Wick, “You honor me by bringing death to my front door.”</p><p>Wick retorts in Russian, “<em>I am a child of the Belarus. An orphan of your tribe. You are bound to help me</em>.” He explicitly evokes the  tribalism inherent in humans, the us vs. them impulse that social media amplifies. And then, in English, “You are bound, and I am owed.” The particular power of tribalism is the near impossibility of being neutral; to not pick any side is to be against everyone. The Director succumbs.</p>\n",

      "<p>As she walks him through the backstage training area of the theater, where other young assassins are in training, she says, “You know when my pupils first come here, they wish for one thing. A life free of suffering. I try to dissuade them from these childish notions but as you know, art is pain. Life is suffering.” As she says this, a ballerina pulls a toenail off. Social media is suffering, she is saying, but Wick is already in too deep.</p><p>She walks him past a bunch of men wrestling on the ground, future John Wicks in training.</p><p>She continues, “Somehow, you managed to get out. But here you are, back where you began. All of this, for what? For a dog?”</p><p>“It wasn’t just a dog,” he replies.</p><p>“The High Table wants your life. How can you fight the wind? How can you smash the mountains? How can you bury the ocean? How can you escape from the light? Of course you can go to the dark. But they’re in the dark, too.”</p><p>Huston is saying that the only way to avoid the darkness of social media is to avoid it, but, as he says, it wasn’t just a dog. She points him to the path out of the outrage cycle, nothing that it’s not a game you can win (How can you fight the wind? That is, there’s always another faceless troll.), but for Wick it’s a matter of honor.</p><p>She cashes in his marker, acceding to his request for safe passage to  Casablanca.</p><p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.sho.com/billions/cast/taylor-mason\">Taylor Mason</a>. Err, sorry, the Adjudicator, played by Asia Kate Dillon. Employed by the High Table, she informs both Winston of the NY Continental and another character nicknamed the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) that they must abdicate their positions in seven days for having aided Wick in killing Santino (in John Wick 2). </p><p>If you’re a liberal, the Adjudicator is like the conservative government officials who’ve continually accused social media platforms of an anti-conservative bias, or the both-sides-ism of the media. If you’re a conservative, the Adjudicator is some metaphor for the liberal media, punishing social media platforms for anything other than absolute conformity to liberal narratives. Sometimes, when Twitter works itself into a rage at another NYTimes headline that isn’t tough enough on Trump, I think of the Adjudicator as the public, holding the newspaper to account for its failure to answer to the collective public High Table.</p><p>In Casablanca, Wick calls on another friend, Sofia (the ageless Halle Berry making a nice pair with the ageless Keanu), with whom he cashes in yet another marker. She, like The Director earlier, is not happy to be pulled into Wick’s personal battles. Sofia runs another branch of the Continental, so essentially Wick has fled one tech platform for another that feels obligated to shelter him. He may be excommunicado from the NY Continental, but he once came to Sofia’s aid, and she owes him.</p><p>“You do realize that I’m management now, right? I’m not service anymore, John, so I don’t go around shooting people in the head,” Sofia notes. She’s essentially a tech platform executive now, trying to avoid getting pulled into social media battles.</p><p>“Look, I made a deal when I agreed to run this hotel, and that deal said I had to follow the rules of the High Table,” she says. “If I make one mistake, one enemy, maybe somebody goes looking for my daughter.”</p><p>Sofia faces the risk of being doxxed and having some nutjobs go after her children. Years ago, John helped get Sofia’s daughter out of this dangerous world, and Sofia doesn’t know where she’s been shepherded. She doesn’t want to know because she knows it would put her daughter back in harm’s way.</p><p>“Because sometimes you have to kill what you love.” Sofia speaks for all those who keep their opinions to themselves online because the cost of being cancelled just isn’t worth the cost of being attacked by the mob. If she stays in the game, she will be pulled into vicious battles she wishes no part of. But in removing herself from social media, she loses out on some of the benefits they offer, like the chance to communicate with family and friends, in her case her daughter. Long ago she chose exit.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Manhattan, the Adjudicator visits a sushi stand and calls on the chef and his crew to help enforce penalties against Wick and all who aided him. The chef, named Zero, agrees. He is, like seemingly everyone in this world, an assassin, just as social media turned all of us into soldiers in the culture wars. Zero and his team seem willing to serve the High Table no matter what they demand; like most people, the lure of participating in an online mob is a form of universal human bloodlust. They can also stand in for platform moderators, trying to implement social network speech policies as best as they can.</p><p>First they visit the Director at the Ruska Roma. The Adjudicator confronts her over helping Wick despite his excommunication. </p><p>Huston defends herself. “He had a ticket.”</p><p>The Adjudicator will hear nothing of it. “But a ticket does not stand above the Table.”</p><p>Zero runs a blade through the Director's clasped hands as penalty.</p><p>Time and again, the John Wick mythology points to the seeming futility of the defending one’s values on social media. The price of picking a side is always to suffer egregious violence from the other side with seemingly no real winners, or to be have one's hands slapped by the platforms (or in this case, pierced with a sword).</p><p>Sofia takes Wick to meet her former boss Berrada, as he requests. Berrada runs a mint to manufacture the gold coins and markers that the assassin world operate on. </p><p>“Now this coin, of course, it does not represent monetary value. It represents the commerce of relationships, a social contract in which you agree to partake. Order and rules. You have broken the rules. The High Table has marked you for death.” Berrada describes both the way in which platforms turned our relationships into business arrangements (“commerce” and “contract”), the artificiality of their power—the order and rules are ones the platforms made up—and their power to deplatform or ban anyone who sign the user agreements.</p><p>Berrada asks Wick if he knows the etymology of the word assassin.</p><p>Berrada explains: “But others contend it comes from asasiyyun. Meaning ‘men who are faithful and who abide by their beliefs.’” The Wick Universe, populated with assassins murdering each other in an endless cycle of retribution, is a proxy for the users on social media who cannot stand by idly while others infringe upon their beliefs.</p><p>Wick asks Berrada how to find the Elder, the one who sits above the High Table. Berrada directs him to wander into the desert and hope that the Elder finds him.</p><p>Before Sofia and John can leave, however, Berrada demands something from Sofia in exchange for the favor. In face, he says he will keep one of Sofia’s two dogs, who accompany her everywhere. Again, the dog symbolizes a person’s most sacred values. On social media, we are always being forced by tribal battles to give up some of our values in order to stay out of harm’s way. This time, Sofia refuses.</p><p>Berrada shoots one of the dogs, but it is wearing a bulletproof vest (hey yo social media wars are vicious you can never be too cautious). Sofia huddles over her dog, then draws a handgun hidden under its vest.</p><p>John sees what she is doing and urges her, “No.”</p><p>But it’s too late. The thing about social media is that it takes just one savage troll to put us on tilt. Sofia shoots Berrada in the leg, and just like that she’s back in the culture wars.</p><p>After she and her dogs and John kill off Berrada’s nearby henchmen, she walks over to Berrada and considers shooting him in the head. </p><p>“Sofia, don’t,” urges John.</p><p>She shoots him in the knee instead. “He shot my dog.”</p><p>“I get it,” he replies, in the funniest line in the film. Anyone who has dealt with an online mob empathizes with friends when they fall under attack and go berserk in response.</p>\n",

      "<p>I believe mass entertainment suffers from a bit of format rigidity due to the natural inertia from structural ossification in the music, film, and publishing businesses, to name the most prominent.</p>\n",
      "<p>One of the ways this manifests is in the one-way broadcast nature of much of our entertainment despite the fact that several billion people own internet-connected smartphones now, and even though they consume an increasingly large share of that entertainment on such devices equipped with all sorts of input options and sensors.</p>\n",
      "<p>Whenever I say this, however, people seem to want to leap to choose-your-own-adventure storytelling, and the most cited example is Netflix’s <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80988062\">Bandersnatch</a>. In its earnings report for 2018, Netflix famously declared “We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO.” I happen to agree with them that the threat of gaming looms larger than any other in the future, and it’s not surprising to me that they’ve spun up a group to experiment with interactive stories like Bandersnatch and Bear Grylls’ <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80227574\">You vs. Wild</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, stories like Bandersnatch fall into an uncanny valley of interactivity. That is, compared to regular movies, they repeatedly force you to do a bit of annoying work that breaks the suspension of disbelief and the flow of the story: the first choice you’re offered in Bandersnatch is to choose which cereal to eat for breakfast. If you’re in the mindset for lean-back entertainment, you can let the story choose an answer for you on its own after some amount of time, but the distracting question prompt is still displayed on the screen.</p>\n",
      "<p>On the other hand, if you want real interactivity, something like Bandersnatch feels like a busted low-res knockoff of the continuous interactivity of video games, a step function compared to the smooth curves of video game calculus. Why play a game with such crude branching when so many great games, many of them multiplayer and synchronous, offer a truly unpredictable and immersive form of user controllable storytelling?</p>\n",
      "<p>This doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy branching stories in concept. One of my favorite movie and television genres is what I refer to as the <strong>recursive escape room</strong> genre.</p>\n",
      "<p>You’re likely familiar with it from its most famous examples. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35uthIP\">Groundhog Day</a> (in fact TVTropes refers to this genre as the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop\">Groundhog Day Loop</a>). <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZWa7KV\">Edge of Tomorrow</a>. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627\">Russian Doll</a>.

Every time I came to a choice in the story, I’d dog-ear that page, then eventually revisit it to take the other path, until I’d read every possible branch of the story. However, works like Groundhog Day reduce the effort required of the viewer by simply playing all the branches in a linear fashion, offering both a lean-back viewing experience and the sensation of narrative progression as the protagonist moves closer and closer to breaking out of the loop. Bandersnatch offers the ability to jump back to any decision you made previously and change it through a sort of decision history carousel, but that still requires work on the part of the viewer.</p>\n",

      "<p>The appeal of recursive escape room movies and TV shows, I theorize, lies in its echo of something many people feel, that they are trapped in some runaway routine in their lives. Wake up, go to work, come home, scrounge up dinner, unwind a bit, then back at it the next day. These recursive escape room stories offer up the possibility that we can puzzle our way out of these Moebius prisons which keep depositing us back to the same starting point. Maybe if I stop eating carbs. Or meditate in the morning instead of checking social media. Or start working out before the morning commute. Maybe if I’m more assertive and ask for a raise, or a promotion, which I richly deserve. With every test, I close off one branch but converge a little more on a solution.</p>\n",
      "<p>I’d guess that the easiest way to predict how any person’s day will go is to look at the previous day. It’s quite plausible that most lived days on Earth feel like a barely modified replay of the previous day. We all run, for the most part, a standard script of life routines.</p>\n",
      "<p>The appeal of self-help gurus and podcasts about the habits of successful people is that they resemble those escape room chaperones who offer occasional hints to groups who get stuck on one particular puzzle. These secrets to success from modern gurus feel like video game tips for specific levels, except for real life. Sleep more. Eat keto. Lift weights. Delete social media apps. Walk 10,000 steps a day.</p>\n",
      "<p>That sense of progressive mastery is a hell of a drug. That’s why, while I’m bearish on choose-your-own-adventure films like Bandersnatch, I’m bullish on the right types of light interactivity when it makes sense. If you were designing a game show today, for example, it would likely look much more like HQTrivia (RIP) than, say, Wheel of Fortune.</p>\n",

Still, when I look at the progressive mastery tactics of something like Candy Crush, I can’t help but find them more fun and effective, in some ways, than the Suzuki method of teaching violin playing, or Mr. Miyagi’s “wax on, wax off” school of teaching Daniel Larusso karate.</p>\n",
      "<p>The more I read about the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aK91py\">power of habit in human behavior</a>, the more I think of self-help genre as a series of macros one downloads to try to upgrade one's day-to-day regimen.

      "<p>DC may lag behind the Marvel Universe in box office and audience acclaim, but it feels like DC is starting to find its footing with a different approach. Rather than having its directors conform to the ultimate vision of Kevin Feige, as Marvel does, DC seems to be allowing its directors a bit more creative freedom to put their own spin on various characters and franchises. Whether you liked The Joker or not, it was a very Todd Phillips-esque take, and it’s not even meant to be part of the rest of the DC Universe. It’s a stand-alone vision of The Joker.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGM4uYZzfu0\">trailer for Birds of Prey</a>, for example, feels like an attempt to take Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and create a new franchise around that character. The Joker in Suicide Squad, and thus the one that’s implied to be in that branch of the DC Universe, isn’t the same one as in the Phillips’ Joker film. But Birds of Prey director Cathy Yan has stated that they removed the Jared Leto Joker character from their film so they could distance (read: quarantine) themselves from that failed film, creating yet another distinct franchise within the DC universe. Not for nothing is the parenthetical in the title \"The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn.\"<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-demo\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-demo\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">After Birds of Prey came out, I saw it. Sad to say I didn't love it, but the critical and fan reception in my network was reasonably positive.</span> Whereas all the Marvel films exist in a single comic universe, DC seems to be sprouting all sorts of independent branches. Perhaps we should think of the DC Universe as the MCU but with social distancing.</p><p>Watchmen capitalizes on this creative freedom. Alan Moore, the writer of the original Watchmen graphic novel, isn’t involved. I’m not sure if he would have given his blessing to Lindelof’s revisions to Watchmen lore<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-demo\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-demo\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">Hahahahaha let's be real he would've never given his blessing.</span>, but it wouldn’t have mattered. HBO and Warner Bros. and the DC folks gave Lindelof free rein to fork the Watchmen mythology for this new series.</p><p>Lindelof’s public breakthrough was as co-creator of Lost. To this day, it remains one of my favorite examples of what I call <strong>narrative debt</strong>. That is, when you’re building out a story, you tease plot lines and characters and conflicts that you have to resolve at a later point in the script.</p><p>You accumulate narrative debt. The implicit promise to the audience, the debt holders, is that you’ll pay out the disbelief they've suspended on your behalf.</p><p>For a whole variety of reasons, Lost was saddled with so much narrative debt that at some point it was effectively insolvent. Pair that with an obsessive fan base poring over every frame for clues like auditors examining the narrative balance sheet and you had a recipe for a write-down of WeWork proportions. The showrunners couldn’t declare narrative bankruptcy as the show’s ratings were still solid, but they tried to prepare the fans for disappointment via public statements. Ultimately, they whipsawed fans through a series of dramatic story pivots until they were forced to crash land the story in the finale in a way that took the story full circle. The viewers at the end were like Jack and the other survivors on that beach in the series premiere, dazed and bloodied, wondering what the hell had happened.</p><p><a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun\">Chekhov’s gun</a> is the most famous instantiation of the principle of conservation of narrative. Some people want the ledger of stories to balance perfectly. Every first act gun must go off in act three. All non-essential plot elements should be dropped. Not surprisingly, Chekhov was a master of the short story, a form which demands concision.</p><p>I’m less of a stickler for obsessively manicured stories than some, though I can nitpick plot structure with the worst of those YouTube critics. I tend to do so only if a film or show is marketed as having been assembled with the delicacy of an expensive wristwatch (Watchmen reference!). There is a certain elegance to a plot in which every last element connects, but as the years go by I find that type of clinical precision can leave a show or film feeling a bit stifled and lifeless.<label class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\" for=\"sn-demo\"></label><input class=\"margin-toggle\" id=\"sn-demo\" type=\"checkbox\" /><span class=\"sidenote\">In the original Watchmen, Adrian Veidt can be thought of as a director trying to pull off a massive fork of the global narrative. A la Fincher's The Game, he does it in the real world. Of course, his is a Shyamalan-like effort that hinges entirely on a last minute plot twist, and as we've seen from Shyamalan's later works, often the narrative debt load is too heavy to recover from.</span></p><p>Lindelof seems to be at his best riffing off of something less open-ended. The confines of an existing piece of intellectual property seem to provide guardrails within which his creative forks seem to flourish. <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers\">The Leftovers</a> had Tom Perrotta’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33f5LjM\">novel</a> to establish the inciting incident, and he and Lindelof expanded that into one of my favorite television shows, a moving meditation on how humans grapple with loss and grief and faith.</p><p>Watchmen from HBO has Moore’s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34a9aiA\">classic graphic novel</a> as a narrative precedent, but Lindelof has remixed it as a story about white supremacy and the racial sin at the heart of America’s origin.</p><p>I often think of TikTok as a logical modern outgrowth of remix and sampling culture, but the television world conjuring a remix of Watchmen is one of the most pleasant surprises of 2019.</p><p>As large media conglomerates focus more and more on franchises, I’d love to see some of the more progressive leaders at those companies contemplate whether a limited open source strategy on their premium intellectual properties might not be the most defensible, modern approach.</p><p>Over a decade ago, Marc Andreessen <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080229163206/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/analyzing_the_f.html\">defined a platform</a> as “a system that can be reprogrammed and therefore customized by outside developers -- users -- and in that way, adapted to countless needs and niches that the platform’s original developers could not have possibly contemplated, much less had time to accommodate.”</p><p>Even longer ago, in 1986, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons released a twelve-issue comic book series titled Watchmen. Decades later, an outside writer named Damon Lindelof read a piece titled “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">The Case for Reparations</a>” by Ta-Nehisi Coates in the Atlantic and learned about the Tulsa, Oklahoma massacre of 1921, remixed it with Moore and Gibbon’s original creation Watchmen, and produced an unexpected new take on the franchise which I don’t think anyone saw coming when the series was first announced.</p><p>Watchmen is a platform.</p>~\n",
      "<blockquote><p class=\"\">“When a judge walks into the room, and everybody stands up, you’re not standing up to that guy, you’re standing up to the robe that he’s wearing and the role that he’s going to play. What makes him worthy of that role is his integrity, as a representative of the principles of that role, and not some group of prejudices of his own. So what you’re standing up to is a mythological character. I imagine some kings and queens are the most stupid, absurd, banal people you could run into, probably interested only in horses and women, you know. But you’re not responding to them as personalities, you’re responding to them in their mythological roles. When someone becomes a judge, or President of the United States, the man is no longer that man, he’s the representative of an eternal office; he has to sacrifice his personal desires and even life possibilities to the role that he now signifies.”</p><p class=\"\">Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers' <a href=\"https://amzn.to/350TTSQ\">The Power of Myth</a></p></blockquote><p class=\"\">When I think of Netflix's originals taking the leap to that level of professional craftsmanship that put them in that tier considered \"premium video,\" for however long that term endures, the show that leaps to mind is <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678\">The Crown</a>, one of my favorite of their homegrown series. House of Cards came earlier, and landing that Fincher production with that cast was a massive coup, but The Crown, with its focus on the English monarchy, carries that air of gentrified prestige that seems apt in a discussion of what qualifies as professional film and television.</p><p class=\"\">The Crown is comfort food for those who prize a level of tightly structured scripts, lavish production design that likely broke out a line item for brocade, precise diction from the school of classical acting that could wouldn’t feel out of place on the stage at the Old Vic, upper lips as stiff as the creases in the tailored English suits on display, long glances freighted with import...in other words, all the trappings of aristocratic melodrama. The portentous <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/52IkG0BbNmrz4zUcnsN7Uf?si=XjhBwp31TUS1pA2enKa0gQ\">theme song</a> by Hans Zimmer is one that, like the theme to Game of Thrones, I won't skip, just so I can wrap it around me like a gravity blanket in anticipation for the theatrics to come. The entire affect of the show dances on that fine line between spectacle and farce; rarely has a program treated a group of people who do so little with such gravitas.</p><p class=\"\">But, <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/and-i-cannot-stress-this-enough\">and I cannot stress this enough</a>, <strong>that is the point</strong>.</p><p class=\"\">Why do we treat the Royal Family with such reverence? Because ceremony demands it. Sometimes status is a closed circle, and if you trace it you end up where you started. The very act of walking in that circle, though, closes it. The Royal Family has whatever power the people grant them.</p><p class=\"\">The very existence of The Crown, the white velvet gloves with which the show handles its subject, enacts, in televisual form, the act of veneration upon which the Royal Family depends for its status. The show bends the knee, and so do we.</p><p class=\"\">No episode better reflects the way in which our construction of royalty and celebrity rhyme than season 1, episode 5 of The Crown, titled \"Smoke and Mirrors.\" This episode is about the covenant between the famous and those who grant them that fame. It's figuratively, and sometimes literally, smoke and mirrors which turn a plain English woman into a queen. In an age where the internet has once again reshaped the distribution topology of moving images, and given that the Crown returns for its third season this Sunday, it seemed the right time to do a walkthrough of this, an episodes of TV I’ve seen many times and which never ceases to move me.</p><p class=\"\">Episode SPOILERS ahead, obviously, though this is one of those programs where spoilers don't mean much. The journey of watching this show is the experience. I encourage you to grab your remote, fire up Netflix, and follow along. Honestly, if you haven't watched episodes 1 through 4 of season one, it's  still fine, but if you want, binge those and then follow along here. I haven’t done an episode walkthrough on my blog before, and honestly this would be better as a video essay, but good luck with that given all the legal hurdles. As it is, Netflix makes it so difficult to grab screenshots of their content that I could only grab so many before losing patience, but I'll drop in some relevant shots from time to time to help you follow along (Netflix, make it easier to grab and share screenshots of your stuff, your whole competitive advantage is economies of scale, you want to overwhelm the competition with your digital footprint in the cultural conversation).</p><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">The episode begins with a flashback to May 11, 1937. Young Elizabeth is summoned, by her father, on the cusp of becoming King George VI, played by the always magisterial Jared Harris. He'd like her to play the role of Archbishop as he prepares for his own coronation. As she reads over the script of the coronation oath, her father explains the significance of the words. She stumbles over a word she doesn't recognize.</p><p class=\"\">Her father pronounces it for her. \"Inviolably. It means, to make a promise you can never break. A very sacred promise indeed.\" He is instilling in her a sense of the heavy obligations transferred in this ceremony, ones which form the foundation of the power of the throne.</p><p class=\"\">They're interrupted by Private Secretary Tommy Lascelles telling George it's time to go try on the crown. George asks for a bit more time with Elizabeth. \"We haven't even reached the anointing!\"</p><p class=\"\">George turns to his daughter.</p><p class=\"\">\"You have to anoint me, otherwise I can't be King. Do you understand? When the holy oil touches me, I am transformed. Brought into direct contact with the divine. &lt;cue the track “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/0kVy9D25VGQOummP2N9yPQ?si=ovd2fzh_QDOfmYLlyubx5w\">The Anointing</a>” by Rupert Gregson-Williams&gt; Forever changed. Bound to god. It is the most important part of the entire ceremony.\" </p><p class=\"\">George refers both to the ceremony by which he becomes King but also the power of film itself. We as the audience anoint movie stars, musicians, and athletes, and by our adulation, they are forever changed. Fame and status are a covenant between gods and their disciples, just as brands exist in the covenant between companies and their customers.</p><p class=\"\">Elizabeth follow her father to the fitting for the crown.</p><p class=\"\">As George lifts the crown over, he notes, \"Goodness, it's very heavy indeed.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"Five pounds,\" says the attendant.</p><p class=\"\">\"Not to mention the symbolic weight, hmm?\" replies George. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, in every sense.</p><p class=\"\">He looks at himself in the mirror, then turns to look at his daughter, who gazes back.</p>\n",

      "<p class=\"\">\"It's not as easy as it looks,\" says Elizabeth, trying to balance the crown on her head.</p><p class=\"\">\"That's exactly what the King said,\" replies the very same attendant who had been at that shared moment in the past, bridging another generation of royalty.</p><p class=\"\">\"I remember,\" says Elizabeth.</p><p class=\"\">It's the type of meticulously composed shot sequence typical of the series, and this scene always gives me all the feels upon rewatch.</p><p class=\"\">That evening, Elizabeth approaches her husband Philip (played with smarmy charisma by Matt Smith; seriously, this entire cast knocks it out of the park) as they dress in their finest for the ballet. She announces that she'd like him to take over as chairman of her coronation committee.</p><p class=\"\">\"I want to make a public declaration of my trust in you,\" she says to her husband. Everything they do has symbolic value, and she understands the importance of her every act in the eyes of the public.</p><p class=\"\">\"There's no need to matronize me,\" he retorts, using the feminist form of the more common \"patronize.\" An ongoing storyline the first two seasons is Philip's discomfort with standing behind his more powerful wife. Behind every great woman is a jealous man yearning for a return of the patriarchy?</p><p class=\"\">At the ballet, Philip, having mulled it over, gives in. However, he has a request. \"Total control or nothing at all. Those are my terms.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"All right. But don't go mad,\" says Elizabeth.</p><p class=\"\">\"What does that mean?\" he asks.</p><p class=\"\">\"It means just don't go mad. It's a coronation. A service that goes back a thousand years. Some things can't be changed,\" she says. </p><p class=\"\">The immutability and consistency of tradition and ritual reflects but also reinforces power. As Stewart Brand once <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2phdU7z\">wrote</a> of government buildings, there's a reason they are constructed of marble and stone, often in the style of ancient Greek or Roman architecture. The unchanging nature of the building is meant to convey the durability of the institution.</p><p class=\"\">\"Yes, yes, all right,\" says Philip, but his sentiments will soon change.</p><p class=\"\">Now we cut to Paris, where the ingenious construction of this episode begins to reveal itself. Not only is this episode about the very act of television and its ability as a medium to grant power, but the writer embeds a commentary on the coronation within the episode itself. Or commentator, to be precise, and his name is Edward, Duke of Windsor, or David. He was forced to abdicate the throne in 1936 for marrying Wallis Simpson, an American woman twice divorced, and his eviction still stings. Throughout this episode, David Windsor serves as a proxy for how non-royalty view the coronation. Asked by the royal family to not attend the ceremony given what they perceive as his shameful abdication, he will be forced to watch from a viewing party he hosts from his home of exile in Paris.</p><p class=\"\">David and his wife Wallis sit for a magazine profile, posing in a variety of foppish outfits. They may not be tip top royalty anymore, but they're not paupers. Still, as status is relative, and he since he once reached the footstep to the throne, he struggles to find contentment in his current lot in life. The episode traces the very specific nature of his jealousy and resentment, but the general contour of his longing matches that of status-seekers everywhere.</p><p class=\"\">David and Wallis lead the reporter to a private attic room where he keeps mementos of his past glory.</p><p class=\"\">\"Goodness. Bagpipes, too,\" says the reporter, glancing at all the memorabilia filling the room.</p><p class=\"\">\"Yes, I play,\" says David.</p><p class=\"\">\"When he gets homesick,\" adds his wife.</p><p class=\"\">\"And all these photographs of you as King,\" asks the reporter. \"There are none with the crown. Why is that?\"</p><p class=\"\">\"I never made it that far. I never had a coronation.\" This isn't fear of missing out; he just plain missed out.</p><p class=\"\">Back in England, Elizabeth announces to her staff that she has decided her husband will be chairman of her coronation committee. Her Private Secretary Tommy says that's impossible as it's the job of the Duke of Norfolk, the chief butler of England. \"Running the coronation, that's what the Norfolks do,\" says Tommy. That's why we call it tradition, girlie.</p><p class=\"\">Elizabeth cuts the debate short. \"The chairmanship with full autonomy is what he wants. Therefore it is what I want. Norfolk can be vice-chair.\" <a href=\"https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/a50ebea1-0531-4dd7-8b55-0286ad1567ce\">You want zee duck</a>? You cannot have zee duck. You can have zee chicken.</p><p class=\"\">David returns to London to visit his ailing mother Mary, and while there Private Secretary Tommy and the Archbishop deliver the bad news: the Duke of Windsor and his wife aren't welcome at the coronation. David goes on an extended diatribe, calling the Archbishop \"Auld Lang Swine,\" and he quips, in a letter to his wife, that his mother, who passes away while he is England, had blood that ran as \"icy cold when she was alive as it does now she's dead.\" No one bitch slaps as poetically as the English.</p><p class=\"\">In the same letter, as we see a shot of David talking to Elizabeth, we hear him refer to the incoming Queen as \"Shirley Temple\" and his other family members as \"desiccated hyenas.\" This club was dead anyway, says the guy turned away at the door, through his tears.</p><p class=\"\">At Mary's funeral service, Philip notes to Elizabeth that this ceremony is exactly like her father's funeral service. Tradition is so rigid in English corridors of power that nothing changes. He vows her coronation will be different, to reflect her, a young woman, and the \"fast-changing, modern world.\"</p><p class=\"\">At his first coronation committee meeting, Philip presents his thoughts.</p><p class=\"\">\"The eyes of the world will be on us. Britain will be on show, and we must put our best foot forward. In such circumstances, the temptation is to roll out the red carpet and follow the precedent set by the grand and successful coronations of the past. But looking to the past for our inspiration would be a mistake in my view.\"</p><p class=\"\">Philip recognizes that when it comes to the power of his wife’s throne, ritual and reality are in many ways inseparable, and the only way to alter the nature of her power is to adapt the ceremonies that construct it.</p><p class=\"\">He continues. \"Make it less ostentatious, more egalitarian, show more respect and sensitivity to the real world. We have a new sovereign, young, and a woman. Let us give her a coronation that is befitting of the wind of change that she represents, modern and forward-looking at a moment in time where exciting technological developments are making things possible we never dreamt of which brings me to my next point...\"</p><p class=\"\">And what, pray tell, is that technology? Television. Of course, we are watching him talk about this on a television series streamed through an application called Netflix that is itself an adaptation of television itself, and you’re reading about my discussion of this episode through the internet. Also, later David Windsor will describe the coronation ceremony to an audience viewing the coronation on a television at his house in Paris. This episode is thematic Inception and I am here for it, every bit.</p><p class=\"\">The committee is horrified by Philip’s plan. At Westminster Abbey, where preparations are underway, one committee member examines a television camera with apprehension and disgust and asks Philip, \"No close-ups, huh? Zoom lenses?\" In the aristocracy’s classical conception of power, physical distance is how status gaps are both constructed and measured. Normal people aren't allowed in to see the coronation because they are meant to feel every bit of the expanse between them and the throne.</p>\n",

      "<p class=\"\">But film is its own medium, with its own peculiar powers, and one of those is its ability to alter our spatial reality. When the close-up was invented in film, it unlocked a unique advantage of cinema over theater, the ability to bring us closer to a person than we'd be even in real life. If you were to put your face up against someone so that their face filled your field-of-view as much as a film close-up, you'd be arrested for assaulting their personal space. But in film, we can be simultaneously abstracted from the characters on screen yet halfway up their nostrils.</p><p class=\"\">The craft of acting changed with the advent of the close-up. No longer was it necessary to act in so broad a style (\"Why I oughta smack you in the kisser!\" overacts the old black and white film cowboy). Now, the most subtle of facial expressions, the tiniest crease of one's brow, could register several feet high on the silver screen.</p><p class=\"\">But more than that, the close-up, in closing distances, offered an alternative to spatially remote constructions of power in favor of a new relationship between star and audience, that of emotional intimacy. The Crown is emblematic of this quality of the film and television medium, spending its long story arc humanizing the Queen of England, transforming her from a remote caricature into a three-dimensional human with a rich and legible inner life. Prior to seeing The Crown, my regard for the Royal Family was, at best, dismissive. They still are. However, my feelings towards the fictional character Elizabeth from The Crown, the one played by Claire Foy, is one of deep sympathy. It's not that film can't do shock and awe but that other mediums struggle to match the moving picture for emotional intimacy.</p><p class=\"\">In a way, the hidebound coronation committee is right to be concerned over Philip’s plan. Television as a medium did reconfigure the modern world, and it continues to hold the power to topple established power structures. Winston Churchill (John Lithgow) brings the concerns of the committee to Elizabeth.</p><p class=\"\">\"What is the purpose of the Crown? What is the purpose of the monarchy? Does the crown bend to the will of the people to be audited and accountable? Or should it remain above temporal matters?\" </p><p class=\"\">When the dominant medium of an age shifts, the nature of power shifts with it. Churchill is asking Elizabeth, but also asking himself, whether the advent of television means the two of them must change the means by which they relate to the people they govern.</p><p class=\"\">Ultimately, he leaves the decision in her hands. She visits Philip at the Abbey where they debate his proposed changes.</p><p class=\"\">She confronts him, \"Trade unionists and businessmen? In the Abbey?\"</p><p class=\"\">\"If you want to stay on the throne, yes,\" he replies.</p><p class=\"\">\"In a trimmed-down televised coronation?\"</p><p class=\"\">\"If you want to avoid a revolution, yes. You forget, I have seen first-hand what it is like for a royal family to be overthrown because they were out of step with the people. I left Greece in an orange crate. My father would have been killed. My grandfather was. I'm just trying to protect you.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"From whom? The British people? You have no idea who they are or what they want.\" She continues, \"If the people are hungry, they want something that lifts them up.\"</p><p class=\"\">\"And how do you propose lifting them if they cannot see it?\" he fires back.</p><p class=\"\">\"The people look to the monarchy for something bigger than themselves. An inspiration. A higher ideal. If you put it in their homes, allow them to watch it with their dinner on their laps...\"</p><p class=\"\">\"It will democratize it, make them feel hat they share in it. Understand it.\" Rewatching this episode today, I can’t help but think of AOC live streaming on Instagram Stories from Washington DC, explaining arcane Congressional procedures in the newest of mediums.</p><p class=\"\">Elizabeth sees the determination in Philip's face, and she caves. She agrees to televising the coronation.</p><p class=\"\">But then she turns the tables on him. He's not the only one who understands the significance of the coronation ceremony and she has a change in mind as well. She has heard of one of his proposed changes to the ceremony that she is not budging on.</p><p class=\"\">\"But on one condition,\" she explains. \"That you kneel.\" Eat your heart out Danaerys, you weren't the first TV queen to ask her man to bend the knee.</p>\n",

The actual broadcast, in 1953 (still <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52NTjasbmgw\">available on YouTube</a>), preserved the sacred nature of the anointing, shielding it from mortal eyes. The Crown, a television show in the 21st century, has a different goal.</p><p class=\"\">The Archbishop begins the oath. \"Will you maintain and preserve...\" He pauses, tripping on on his memory. He did not stumble during the actual coronation, but showrunner Peter Morgan adds this moment in order to tie the episode back to the opening of the episode when a young Elizabeth rehearsed the ceremony with her father. It's a bit of dramatic license that pays for itself with the emotional round-trip.</p><p class=\"\">Elizabeth realizes the Archbishop's predicament and steps in to complete the Oath for him. \"Inviolably?\" she says. Her father taught her the meaning of the word when they rehearsed the oath some 17 years prior, and in reciting it once again, she has now finally internalized the weight of the office, as her father did before her. She bonds across time with her deceased father, one more time.</p><p class=\"\">\"I will,\" she proceeds, completing the oath.</p><p class=\"\">Next we see product-commercial-grade closeups of the holy oil, backlit as if it were the nectar of the gods, and effectively it is.

Whereas earlier Windsor mocked his family, dismissed the Queen, and punctured the pomp with sarcastic quips, now he can't help but be spellbound by the symbolic force of it all. In a beautiful shot, we see his face, full of yearning, reflected in his TV screen, his niece, now his Queen, on screen.</p>\n",

The internet can cajole you into feeling as if you only exist through the act of posting.</p><p class=\"\">Jia Tolentino writes in her great essay collection <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Np1Pb3\">Trick Mirror</a>:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">As more people began to register their existence digitally, a pastime turned into an imperative: you had to register yourself digitally to exist.</p><p class=\"\">...</p><p class=\"\">The dream of a better, truer self on the internet was slipping away. Where we had once been free to be ourselves online, we were now chained to ourselves online, and this made us self-conscious.</p><p class=\"\">...</p><p class=\"\">As a medium, the internet is defined by a built-in performance incentive. In real life, you can walk around living life and be visible to other people. But you can’t just walk around and be visible on the internet—for anyone to see you, you have to act. You have to communicate in order to maintain an internet presence.</p><p class=\"\">...</p><p class=\"\">To try to write online, more specifically, is to operate on a set of assumptions that are already dubious when limited to writers and even more questionable when turned into a categorical imperative for everyone on the internet: the assumption that speech has an impact, that it’s something like action; the assumption that it’s fine or helpful or even ideal to be constantly writing down what you think.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">I tweet, therefore I am? Internet participation can feel like being on tour in perpetuity, and the feedback loops can feel like a noose, one that you tighten yourself.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The rhetorical style of any Twitter account that continues to gain followers converges on that of a fortune cookie.</p>— Eugene Wei (@eugenewei) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/998714814749802496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2018</a></blockquote>\n",
      "<p class=\"\">At what level of compression of thought on Twitter does any bit of specific wisdom get squeezed out of a thought?</p><p class=\"\">Sometimes I wonder if the natural asymptote of an increasingly popular Twitter account is a parody of that same account. Could we train a GAN on some of the more prolific and consistent Twitter accounts to create Westworld-like clones, indistinguishable from the original? Could we create a parallel Twitter where these simulations of iconic accounts would live on in perpetuity, dispensing compressed nuggets of advice that straddle the line between profundity and banality, interacting with each other, believing that they and all of their peers were humans? Maybe we are all destined to become bots.</p><p class=\"\">A long hiatus is a good test of what you truly miss, however, and I do miss the masochistic act of hammering a piece into some usable shape, and I miss the give-and-take with my readers. Thoughtful discourse hasn’t left the internet, it just isn’t happening in the public squares, for a variety of reasons I’ll dive into this month.</p><p class=\"\">After my last post on <a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service\">Status as a Service</a>, I received a lot of thought-provoking email, and in the ensuing months I’ve chatted for many hours with all sorts of people from operators to investors. I plan to spend some of my next few posts to respond to the most common points and questions my readers raised. A lot of these ideas have been renting a sofa in my head these past few months, and I need to Marie Kondo my brain cache.</p><p class=\"\">Before doing that, a few updates.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/eugene-wei-explains-why-were-all-status-monkeys-on/id1080467174?i=1000438218843\">I appeared on Peter Kafka's Recode Media podcast earlier this year to discuss Status as a Service</a>. Peter has long been one of the journalists I follow on media/tech news, and podcasting has allowed him to be even more prolific and discursive on the topic; we all benefit. And while I love that podcasters can just show up with minimal equipment and start recording, it's always fun to go into the Vox studios, into a noise-proof room, don headphones, and speak into a high-end microphone. Rarely do I feel as, dare I say it, high status. Check out our conversation for a sense of how I've been updating my views on status as it relates to the tech sector.</p><p class=\"\">My second update is that this is the first of my posts to be sent via <a href=\"https://eugenewei.substack.com/\">Substack</a> instead of <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a>. I grew out of the free tier of Mailchimp a while ago and the monthly bills were adding up even though I hadn't sent anything in months. I switched over to Substack even before they announced that A16Z would lead their latest round of funding, but I'd like to think the sequencing was causal (just kidding, it was not, and congrats to the Substack team who were friendly and helpful in getting me switched over smoothly).</p><p class=\"\">Substack will allow me to selectively choose when to email my blog posts out, allowing my mailing list and blog to be separate entities. I'll still distribute or link to most of my posts via my mailing list, but on occasion, I may post something that's more blog-related housekeeping that won't be of interest to my email list, and, conversely, something may feel best suited for my mailing list but not my blog. I hesitate to consider myself in the newsletter business—I know, I know, another newsletter to clog your inbox, on top of the countless podcasts you already can’t keep up with—but if you're interested in reading all of my work, <a href=\"https://eugenewei.substack.com/\">sign up for my Substack</a>. If you're already on my mailing list, the backend has changed from Mailchimp to Substack, but otherwise you shouldn't notice any difference.</p><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">I titled this column Status Update because it was another of the titles I considered for my previous post. I always found it apt that Facebook referred to its posts as \"statuses.\" That so many people use their posts to try to \"update\" their status—usually to try and raise it—made the term \"status update\" just too wonderfully loaded.</p><p class=\"\">If you think of social networks as programmable interfaces, then each post on the network updates the contributor's status in a way that makes the nature of status on that network self-describing. You can even think of the impossibly long feeds and databases of all these social networks as one massive blockchain that all users are furiously writing to, trying to establish consensus around their relative status in the community.</p><p class=\"\">My two principles of status were inspired, in part, by the two axioms of cosmic sociology from the science-fiction novel <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ETSEJU\">The Dark Forest</a>, the second in Liu Cixin's epic Three-Body Trilogy. Those two axioms:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">First: Survival is the primary need of civilization.</p><p class=\"\">Second: Civilization continuously grows and expands, but the total matter in the universe remains constant.</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">I've always appreciated how the entire trilogy of novels derives, in part, from just those two axioms, though it takes some time for the reader to understand just how. In part, Status as a Service (StaaS) was an attempt to see how far I could extrapolate from just two axioms.</p><p class=\"\">On to reader feedback. One point I heard from quite a few people was, “I don't use [insert social network of choice] for status.” </p><p class=\"\">Of course, not everyone uses every social network purely for status, and as I noted in my piece, there are two other axes on which a social media services can construct a healthy business, utility and entertainment (I'll cover those axes in future posts as there are specific reasons I settled on those three in particular). Just as I would never claim that everything people do is in pursuit of status, no social network operates entirely on that dimension. And, of course, not everyone needs status from a network. Beyoncé doesn't need social media to earn status, she merely uses social media to harvest her already prodigious social capital. Your mileage, as compared to Beyoncé, may vary.</p><p class=\"\">On the other hand, when I hear people claim they aren’t status-seeking, my initial thought is, “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/style/ok-boomer.html\">Okay boomer.</a>” Well, perhaps that’s not quite right, but something along those lines. What it reveals is just how negative a valence the word \"status\" and the adjective \"status-seeking\" have today. Perhaps because we've long thought of status as a relative standing, and status competition as a zero-sum game, we find \"status-seeking\" personally threatening and distasteful all at once. </p><p class=\"\">However, when I talk about seeking a sense of self-worth, a feeling of belonging and achievement, people have only positive reactions. Are those behaviors so easily titrated apart? I'm skeptical. But to all of you offended by being called \"status-seeking,\" I apologize and applaud your lack of ego. I'm not saying that because I mean to raise your status, but...ah never mind.</p><p class=\"\">The most common question I heard in response to Status as a Service was what spurred the piece. While it’s often difficult with fiction to pinpoint the origin of things, with an essay it’s easier to retrace the journey, or at least to point at specific ingredients.</p><p class=\"\">One of the itches that spurred the piece was that my previous essay <a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes\">Invisible Asymptotes</a> had me puzzling over why various social networks had collided with the shoulder of the S-curve after some prolonged period of hockey stick growth. Metcalfe's Law and the basic network effects theories that dominate discussion of networks would predict otherwise. While I offered some light exploration of the asymptotes for various social networks in that piece, it felt as if a giant variable was missing in the equation. The concept that best solved the equation in my mental backtests was status.</p><p class=\"\">I also focused on status because, since it was my missing variable, it felt like the least understood aspect of social networks. I suppose that is tautological in structure, but it’s also endemic to mining for a new explanation for some phenomenon. There's always a risk in conjuring a single variable to make any equation work, but for argument's sake, I held the other variables constant and used status to the fullest extent possible, in search of its limitations.</p><p class=\"\">What seems clear and almost obvious in hindsight is that not all nodes on a social network are equal and that different configurations of those nodes also matter. The quantity of nodes and connections isn’t sufficient to measure the value of a network alone. Two networks of similar size in nodes and connections may differ widely in stability and potential and kinetic energy. Status differences can be thought of as differences in the size of nodes and the configuration of them.</p><p class=\"\">One of the critical forms of pattern recognition for anyone studying, investing in, or running these networks is learning which arrangements of what types of nodes are stable and which are inherently brittle or even volatile. That requires understanding a network’s status dynamics.</p><p class=\"\">Much of my work advising companies recently has been helping them to understand which type of network configuration makes the most sense for the business they are in. While the past can be full of patterns that are about to implode, there's much to glean from studying previous network collapses because status dynamics remain, like much of human nature, fairly consistent across time. Digital anthropology is underrated.</p><p class=\"\">For example, long ago, night clubs and dating apps understood that a successful marketplace equilibrium almost always begins with women as the supply side, not men. That's why if you're a guy you have wait in line for a long time just for the privilege of paying a cover charge at many clubs; meanwhile, groups of women are ushered in for free. How do you bypass the line as a group of men? By paying for bottle service, contributing to a very particular stable social equilibrium inside the club (not to mention a profitable one; witness the surge in % of floor space devoted to bottle service booths in Las Vegas clubs this past decade).</p><p class=\"\">Any multi-sided marketplace veteran or observer now understands much more about how to sequence their efforts, and whether to focus on the supply or demand side first and why. <a href=\"http://investorfieldguide.com/gurley/\">Bill Gurley appeared on Patrick O'Shaughnessy's Invest Like the Best podcast</a> and spoke to the differences between monogamous marketplaces, where two parties match exclusively for a long-term relationship (for example, finding a nanny for your children) and marketplaces where people just match up for a single transaction (Uber, for example). Li Jin and D'Arcy Coolican of A16Z have written <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/03/29/is-it-a-network-effect/\">several pieces about network effects</a> that continue to fill in the nuance between the platitudes.</p><p class=\"\">Despite all that, the industry still has a ways to go in incorporating status into its operations. One of the clearest ways this manifests is in the metrics most social networks monitor and report on. Almost all of them aggregate a lot of individual user behavior into aggregate stats. However, just as it's very dangerous to munge cohorts into one lump, failing to understand subgroup status dynamics and configurations among a giant social network disguises a lot of what's actually going on. The trends of the group can diverge from the actual dynamics of various subgroups. Your stats could be growing, they could be declining, and yet you have no idea why. Some competitor comes along and starts stealing market share, and yet on the surface they look like a smaller, subpar version of your network.</p><p class=\"\">The topic of how social companies should analyze their networks is a topic worth a book in itself, and it's clear that we're very early in that journey. Many social networks continue to have no idea when they are about to hit a wall, with less visibility into the future than a club owner who comes in night after night and notices, gazing across the dance floor, realizes one night that the joint has lost its heat. When people refer to Facebook as a boomer ghetto, they're referring first to a decline in social capital, which precedes the loss of human capital</p><p class=\"\">More on this soon, but for the remainder of this update, I want to look back at the 21st century to date and marvel at one of the greatest changes in civilization, one wrought by first the internet and second by the rise of massive social networks.</p><p class=\"\">***</p><p class=\"\">One way to understand the impact of these public social networks on humanity is to think of this as the era in which humans took their personal thoughts and lives public at scale. Billions of humans IPO'd, whether we were ready for it or not, explaining why the concept of a personal \"brand\" became such a pervasive metaphor.</p><p class=\"\">In another era, most of us lived in social circles of limited scope. Family, school, coworkers, neighbors. We were, for the most part, private entities. Social media companies quickly hit on the ideal configuration for rapid network growth: take the interaction between any two people and make it public. Conversation and information-sharing became a democratic form of performance art.</p><p class=\"\">One reason social networks quickly converged on this as the optimal strategy and configuration is that the majority of people on any social network merely lurk. By making the conversations of the more extroverted, productive nodes public, you sustain the interest of that silent majority of observers with what is effectively crowd-sourced (read: free) content. The concept of <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)\">1/9/90</a> is that a stable equilibrium can be achieved in a large network if the <a href=\"http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-shouting-class.html\">shouting class</a>, the minority which entertains the much larger but silent majority, is given enough quantifiable doses of affirmation (likes) to keep the content spigot flowing. As these large public social networks grew, even many who were previously modest began taking the stage on social media to karaoke to the crowd. Live fast, die young, and leave a viral post.</p><p class=\"\">Just as there are many advantages to being a public company, becoming a public figure carries all sorts of upside. Once your ideas and your self are traded publicly, anyone can invest and drive the value of those goods higher. If you’ve ever written a viral blog post or tweetstorm and gained thousands of followers, if you’ve had a YouTube video picked up by traditional media and found yourselves interviewed on the local news, you’ve felt that rush of being a soaring stock. Social networks not only provide public liquidity for anything you care to share on them, but they also continued to tweak their algorithms to accelerate the virality quotient of their feeds. In a previous generation, Warhol quipped the duration of sudden fame was 15 minutes, but social media has made that the time it takes to become famous.</p><p class=\"\">The problem is that, like many private companies who find the scrutiny of public markets overly stringent, many of us were ill-equipped for \"going public\" with what were once private conversations and thought. It's not just those who made enormous public gaffes and got \"canceled.\" Most people by now have experienced the random attack from a troll, the distributed judgment of the public at large, and have realized the cost of living our lives in public. Most celebrities learn this lesson very early on, most companies put their public-facing executives through PR training, but most humans never grew up under the watchful gaze of hundreds of millions of eyes of Sauron.</p><p class=\"\">That dread we feel when our thoughts and selves are traded as public goods is the unease that comes from rendering the personal transactional. Public companies are restricted in what they can say publicly. The same is true for people who take their selves public. The markets punish companies that stumble, and the judgment of the masses is no less harsh for individuals who do their thinking out loud on social media. This new form of public backlash has even earned its own moniker: cancel culture.</p><p class=\"\">One of the most famous and iconic incidents of cancel culture was the tweet that \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html\">blew up Justine Sacco's Life</a>.\" As soon as I mention it, almost any student of Internet culture knows the tweet.</p><p class=\"\">Before boarding the last leg of a flight from New York to Cape Town, Sacco wrote to her 170 Twitter followers at the time:</p><blockquote><p class=\"\">\"Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!\"</p></blockquote><p class=\"\">By the time her flight landed, she had what might be the closest experience to traveling to an alternate universe on a plane since the passengers of Oceanic Flight 815 on the TV series Lost. When Sacco's flight landed and she emerged from the runway into the airport, her phone reaching out to handshake with the network, she stepped into a timeline in which she was an international villain.</p>\n",

But, if you're old enough to remember the pre-internet, pre-social-media era, try to fathom how a single relatively unknown citizen of the world like Sacco could write or utter any sentence of just sixty-four characters and ignite anything remotely comparable to the fury of millions of total strangers from across the globe.</p><p class=\"\">I'd argue that such a feat was impossible in a previous era. The only way someone like Sacco could even reach that many people back then would have been to broadcast such a message through a mainstream media channel like a newspaper or television network, all of which were under the control of a select group of gatekeepers who would've never broadcast her joke in the first place (remember, I'm talking about even the pre-Fox News era).</p><p class=\"\">We've had no shortage of dystopic futures that warned of mass surveillance, but not many of them described a future in which you could destroy your own life with your own words. The Twitter \"What's happening\" prompt box is like a command line with the power to, among other things, obliterate your life. Such is the power of a megaphone that can reach most of the civilized world. Who's up for global open mic night? What could go wrong? Wheeeeeeeeee!</p><p class=\"\">After I read the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2znV9AX\">Three-Body Trilogy</a>, the first metaphor that leapt off the page was the idea of Twitter as The Dark Forest. Many public figures had already gone radio silent online, the downside was so severe. Yancey Strickler recently <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1\">wrote</a> about this idea of the internet as Dark Forest, and if you're not worried about having that metaphor spoiled, click over and give it a read.</p><p class=\"\">Just as the SEC regulates what public companies say, social norms regulate what a person can say on social media. PR training today begins for all of us once we get our hands on our first smartphone. It's little surprise that just as many companies now stay private for longer, many people have retreated to private messaging groups, taking their thoughts back into the shadows, while those who stay public learn to code messages in memes or language so opaque and Straussian that even political dissidents would be impressed.</p><p class=\"\">If your feeling on all this is, good, these people got what they deserved, I understand. Some people who’ve been canceled have written some truly abhorrent things, some of it even illegal, and sometimes it can feel like we live in an age of hyperefficient social Darwinism, a hyperactive white blood cell army patrolling the alleyways of the internet in that distributed swarm style the internet made its own. </p><p class=\"\">But the exact definition of “cancel culture” matters. The closer the social mob is to enforcing the values you believe in, the more just it feels. The more divergent the values of the mob, the more you feel attacked by an army of trolls. I’m not opposed to new forms of social capital regulation enabled by the internet, but social mob behavior can be a mass of unthinking, blind, rage. Like a real-life mob, just bigger, and faster moving. That’s a frightening phenomenon.</p><p class=\"\">As we approach the year 2020, and we look back on two decades where billions of people went public, I’m equal parts astonished and horrified. I imagine a time traveler appearing to a citizen of the pre-internet era in a new age Monkey’s Paw fable, and asking that person, “I can grant you one wish, what do you desire?”</p><p class=\"\">And that person would look at the world around them, all the people going about their business, strolling past and paying them no heed, and they’d say, “Make me famous.”</p>~\n",

This is that piece.</p><h3>Status-Seeking Monkeys</h3><p>\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a person in possession of little fortune, must be in want of more social capital.\"</p><p>So wrote Jane Austen, or she would have, I think, if she were chronicling our current age (instead we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz\">Taylor Lorenz</a>, and thank goodness for that).</p><p>Let's begin with two principles:</p><ul><li><p>People are status-seeking monkeys*</p></li><li><p>People seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital</p></li></ul><p>* Status-Seeking Monkeys will also be the name of my indie band, if I ever learn to play the guitar and start a band</p><p>I begin with these two observations of human nature because few would dispute them, yet I seldom see social networks, some of the largest and fastest-growing companies in the history of the world, analyzed on the dimension of status or social capital.</p><p>It’s in part a measurement issue. Numbers lend an air of legitimacy and credibility. We have longstanding ways to denominate and measure financial capital and its flows. Entire websites, sections of newspapers, and a ton of institutions report with precision on the prices and movements of money.</p><p>We have no such methods for measuring the values and movement of social capital, at least not with anywhere near the accuracy or precision. The body of research feels both broad and yet meager. If we had better measures besides user counts, this piece and many others would be full of charts and graphs that added a sense of intellectual heft to the analysis. There would be some annual presentation called the State of Social akin to Meeker's Internet Trends Report, or perhaps it would be a fifty page sub-section of her annual report.</p><p>Despite this, most of the social media networks we study generate much more social capital than actual financial capital, especially in their early stages; almost all such companies have internalized one of the popular truisms of Silicon Valley, that in the early days, companies should postpone revenue generation in favor of rapid network scaling. Social capital has much to say about why social networks lose heat, stall out, and sometimes disappear altogether. And, while we may not be able to quantify social capital, as highly attuned social creatures, we can feel it.</p><p>Social capital is, in many ways, a leading indicator of financial capital, and so its nature bears greater scrutiny. Not only is it good investment or business practice, but analyzing social capital dynamics can help to explain all sorts of online behavior that would otherwise seem irrational.</p><p>In the past few years, much progress has been made analyzing Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses. Not as much has been made on social networks. Analysis of social networks still strikes me as being like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GROnZ5\">economic growth theory</a> long before <a href=\"http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~promer/Endogenous.pdf\">Paul Romer's paper on endogenous technological change</a>. However, we can start to demystify social networks if we also think of them as SaaS businesses, but instead of software, they provide status. This post is a deep dive into what I refer to as <strong>Status as a Service (StaaS)</strong> businesses.</p><p>Think of this essay as a series of strongly held hypotheses; without access to the types of data which i’m not even sure exists, it’s difficult to be definitive. As ever, my wise readers will add or push back as they always do.</p><h3>Traditional Network Effects Model of Social Networks</h3><p>One of the fundamental lessons of successful social networks is that they must first appeal to people when they have few users. Typically this is done through some form of single-user utility. </p><p>This is the classic cold start problem of social.  The answer to the traditional chicken-and-egg question is actually answerable: what comes first is a single chicken, and then another chicken, and then another chicken, and so on. The harder version of the question is why the first chicken came and stayed when no other chickens were around, and why the others followed.</p><p>The second fundamental lessons is that social networks must have strong network effects so that as more and more users come aboard, the network enters a positive flywheel of growth, a compounding value from positive network effects that leads to hockey stick growth that puts dollar signs in the eyes of investors and employees  alike. <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network/\">\"Come for the tool, stay for the network\"</a> wrote Chris Dixon, in perhaps the most memorable maxim for how this works.</p><p>Even before social networks, we had Metcalfe's Law on telecommunications networks:</p><p>The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2)</p><p>This ported over to social networks cleanly. It is intuitive, and it includes that tantalizing math formula that explains why growth curves for social networks bends up sharply at the ankle of the classic growth S-curve.</p><p>But dig deeper and many many questions remain. Why do some large social networks suddenly fade away, or lose out to new tiny networks? Why do some new social networks with great single-player tools fail to transform into networks, while others with seemingly frivolous purposes make the leap? Why do some networks sometimes lose value when they add more users? What determines why different networks stall out at different user base sizes? Why do some networks cross international borders easily while others stay locked within specific countries? Why, if Metcalfe's Law holds, do many of Facebook's clones of other social network features fail, while some succeed, like Instagram Stories?</p><p>What ties many of these explanations together is social capital theory, and how we analyze social networks should include a study of a social network's accumulation of social capital assets and the nature and structure of its status games. In other words, how do such companies capitalize, either consciously or not, on the fact that people are status-seeking monkeys, always trying to seek more of it in the most efficient way possible?</p><p>To paraphrase Nicki Minaj, “If I'm fake I ain't notice cause my followers ain't.”</p><p>[Editor’s note: sometimes the followers actually are fake.]</p><h3>Utility vs. Social Capital Framework</h3><p>Classic network effects theory still holds, I’m not discarding it. Instead, let's append some social capital theory. Together, those form the two axes on which I like to analyze social network health.</p><p>Actually, I tend to use three axes to dissect social networks.</p>\n",

      "<p>Utility doesn't require much explanation, though we often use the term very loosely and categorize too many things as utility when they aren't that useful (we generally confuse circuses for bread and not the reverse; Fox News, for example, is more entertainment than utility, as is common of many news outlets). A social network like Facebook allows me to reach lots of people I would otherwise have a harder time tracking down, and that is useful. A messaging app like WhatsApp allows me to communicate with people all over the world without paying texting or incremental data fees, which is useful. Quora and Reddit and Discord and most every social network offer some forms of utility.</p><p>The other axis is, for a lack of a more precise term, the social capital axis, or the status axis. Can I use the social network to accumulate social capital? What forms? How is it measured? And how do I earn that status?</p><p>There are several different paths to success for social networks, but those which compete on the social capital axis are often more mysterious than pure utilities. Competition on raw utility tends to be Darwinian, ruthless, and highly legible. This is the world, for example, of communication services like messaging and video conferencing.  Investing in this space also tends to be a bit more straightforward: how useful is your app or service, can you get distribution, etc. When investors send me decks on things in this category, I am happy to offer an opinion, but I enjoy puzzling over the world of artificial prestige even more.</p><p>The creation of a successful status game is so mysterious that it often smacks of alchemy. For that reason, entrepreneurs who succeed in this space are thought of us a sort of shaman, perhaps because most investors are middle-aged white men who are already so high status they haven't the first idea why people would seek virtual status (more on that later).</p><p>With the rise of Instagram, with its focus on photos and filters, and Snapchat, with its ephemeral messaging, and Vine, with its 6-second video limit, for a while there was a thought that new social networks would be built on some new modality of communications. That's a piece of it, but it's not the complete picture, and not for the reasons many people think, which is why we have seen a whole bunch of strange failed experiments in just about every odd combinations of features and filters and artificial constraints in how we communicate with each other through our phones. Remember Facebook's Snapchat competitor Slingshot, in which you had to unlock any messages you received by responding with a message? It felt like product design by mad libs.</p><p>When modeling how successful social networks create a status game worth playing, a useful metaphor is one of the trendiest technologies: cryptocurrency.</p><h3>Social Networks as ICO's</h3><p>How is a new social network analogous to an ICO? </p><ol><li><p>Each new social network issues a new form of social capital, a token.</p></li><li><p>You must show proof of work to earn the token.</p></li><li><p>Over time it becomes harder and harder to mine new tokens on each social network, creating built-in scarcity. </p></li><li><p>Many people, especially older folks, scoff at both social networks and cryptocurrencies. </p></li></ol><p>[\"Why does anyone care what you ate for lunch?\" is the canonical retort about any social network, though it’s fading with time. Both social networks and ICO's tend to drive skeptics crazy because they seem to manufacture value out of nothing. The shifting nature of scarcity will always leave a wake of skepticism and disbelief.]</p><p>Years ago, I stayed at the house of a friend whose high school daughter was home upstairs with a classmates. As we adults drank wine in the kitchen downstairs while waiting for dinner to finish in the oven, we heard lots of music and stomping and giggling coming from upstairs. </p><p>When we finally called them down for dinner, I asked them what all the ruckus had been. My friend's daughter proudly held up her phone to show me a recording they'd posted to an app called Musical.ly. It was a lip synch and dance routine replete with their own choreography. They'd rehearsed the piece more times than they could count. It showed. Their faces were shiny with sweat, and they were still breathing hard from the exertion. Proof of work indeed.</p><p>I spent the rest of the dinner scrolling through the app, fascinated, interviewing the girls about what they liked about the app, why they were on it, what share of their free time it had captured. I can't tell if parents are offended or glad when I spend much of the time visiting them interviewing their sons and daughters instead, but in the absence of good enough metrics with which to analyze this space, I subscribe to the Jane Goodall theory of how to study your subject. Besides, status games of adults are already well covered by the existing media, from literature to film. Children's status games, once familiar to us, begin to fade from our memory as time passes, and its modern forms have been drastically altered by social media.</p><p>Other examples abound. Perhaps you've read a long and thoughtful response by a random person on Quora or Reddit, or watched YouTube vloggers publishing night after night, or heard about popular Vine stars living in houses together, helping each other shoot and edit 6-second videos. While you can outsource Bitcoin mining to a computer, people still mine for social capital on social networks largely through their own blood, sweat, and tears.</p><p>[Aside: if you yourself are not an aspiring social network star, living with one is...<a href=\"https://flip.lease/blog/my-roommates-tik-tok-fame-made-my-life-hell\" target=\"_blank\">not recommended</a>.]</p><p>Perhaps, if you've spent time around today's youth, you've watched with a mixture of horror and fascination as a teen snaps dozens of selfies before publishing the most flattering one to Instagram, only to pull it down if it doesn't accumulate enough likes within the first hour. It’s another example of proof of work, or at least vigorous market research.</p><p>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don't pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</p><p>[An aside about exogenous social capital: you might complain that your tweets are more interesting and  grammatical than those of, say, Donald Trump (you're probably right!). Or that your photos are better composed and more interesting at a deep level of photographic craft than those of Kim Kardashian. The difference is, they bring a massive supply of exogenous pre-existing social capital from another status game, the fame game, to every table, and some forms of social capital transfer quite well across platforms. Generalized fame is one of them. More specific forms of fame or talent might not retain their value as easily: you might follow Paul Krugman on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, for example, but not have any interest in his Instagram account. I don't know if he has one, but I probably wouldn't follow it if he did, sorry Paul, it’s nothing personal.]</p><p>If you've ever joined one of these social networks early enough, you know that, on a relative basis, getting ahead of others in terms of social capital (followers, likes, etc.) is easier in the early days. Some people who were featured on recommended follower lists in the early days of Twitter have follower counts in the 7-figures, just as early masters of Musical.ly and Vine were accumulated massive and compounding follower counts. The more people who follow you, the more followers you gain because of leaderboards and recommended follower algorithms and other such common discovery mechanisms.</p><p>It's true that as more people join a network, more social capital is up for grabs in the aggregate. However, in general, if you come to a social network later, unless you bring incredible exogenous social capital (Taylor Swift can join any social network on the planet and collect a massive following immediately), the competition for attention is going to be more intense than it was in the beginning. Everyone has more of an understanding of how the game works so the competition is stiffer.</p><h3>Why Proof of Work Matters</h3><p>Why does proof of work matter for a social network? If people want to maximize social capital, why not make that as easy as possible?</p><p>As with cryptocurrency, if it were so easy, it wouldn't be worth anything. Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans. Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy.</p><p>Musical.ly created a hurdle for gaining followers and status that wasn't easily cleared by many people. However, for some, especially teens, and especially girls, it was a status game at which they were particularly suited to win. And so they flocked there, because, according to my second tenet, people look for the most efficient ways to accumulate the most social capital.</p><p>Recall Twitter in the early days, when it was somewhat of a harmless but somewhat inert status update service. I went back to look at my first few tweets on the service from some 12 years ago and my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/9796071\" target=\"_blank\">first</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/780570653\" target=\"_blank\">two</a>, spaced about a year apart, were both about doing my taxes. Looking back at them, I bore even myself. Early Twitter consisted mostly of harmless but dull life status updates, a lot of “is this thing on?” tapping on the virtual microphone. I guess I am in the camp of not caring about what you had for lunch after all. Get off my lawn, err, phone screen!</p><p>What changed Twitter, for me, was the launch of <a href=\"https://favstar.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">Favstar</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/favrd\" target=\"_blank\">Favrd</a> (both now defunct, ruthlessly murdered by Twitter), these global leaderboards that suddenly turned the service into a competition to compose the most globally popular tweets. Recall, the Twitter graph was not as dense then as it was now, nor did distribution accelerants like one-click retweeting and Moments exist yet.</p><p>What Favstar and Favrd did was surface really great tweets and rank them on a scoreboard, and that, to me, launched the performative revolution in Twitter. It added needed feedback to the feedback loop, birthing a new type of comedian, the master of the 140 character or less punchline (the internet has killed the joke, humor is all punchline now that the setup of the joke is assumed to be common knowledge thanks to Google).</p><p>The launch of these global tweet scoreboards reminds me of the moment in the now classic film** <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TcrjYu\">Battle Royale</a> when Beat Takeshi Kitano informs a bunch of troublemaking school kids that they’ve been deported to an island are to fight to the death, last student standing wins, and that those who try to sneak out of designated battle zones will be killed by explosive collars. I'm not saying that Twitter is a life-or-death struggle, but you need only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/999699093277442048\" target=\"_blank\">time travel back to pre-product-market-fit Twitter</a> to see the vast difference in tone.</p><p>**Now classic because Battle Royale has subsequently been ripped off, err, paid tribute to by The Hunger Games, Fortnite, Maze Runner, and just about every YA franchise out there because who understands barbarous status games better than teenagers?</p>\n",

      "<p>It's critical that not everyone can quip with such skill. This gave Twitter its own proof of work, and over time the overall quality of tweets improved as that feedback loop spun and tightened. The strategies that gained the most likes were fed in increasing volume into people's timelines as everyone learned from and competed with each other.</p><p>Read Twitter today and hardly any of the tweets are the mundane life updates of its awkward pre-puberty years. We are now in late-stage performative Twitter, where nearly every tweet is hungry as hell for favorites and retweets, and everyone is a trained pundit or comedian. It's hot takes and cool proverbs all the way down. The harmless status update Twitter was a less thirsty scene but also not much of a business. Still, sometimes I miss the halcyon days when not every tweet was a thirst trap. I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye, the always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye, I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye.</p><p>Thirst for status is potential energy. It is the lifeblood of a Status as a Service business. To succeed at carving out unique space in the market, social networks offer their own unique form of status token, earned through some distinctive proof of work.</p><p>Conversely, let's look at something like <a href=\"https://prisma-ai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Prisma</a>, a photo filter app which tried to pivot to become a social network. Prisma surged in popularity upon launch by making it trivial to turn one of your photos into a fine art painting with one of its many neural-network-powered filters.</p><p>It worked well. Too well. </p><p>Since almost any photo could, with one-click, be turned into a gorgeous painting, no single photo really stands out. The star is the filter, not the user, and so it didn't really make sense to follow any one person over any other person. Without that element of skill, no framework for a status game or skill-based network  existed. It was a utility that failed at becoming a Status as a Service business.</p><p>In contrast, while Instagram filters, in its earliest days, improved upon the somewhat limited quality of smartphone photos at the time, the quality of those photos still depended for the most part on the photographer. The composition, the selection of subject matter, these still derived from the photographer’s  craft, and no filter could elevate a poor photo into a masterpiece.</p><p>So, to answer an earlier question about how a new social network takes hold, let’s add this: a new Status as a Service business must devise some proof of work that depends on some actual skill to differentiate among users. If it does, then it creates, like an ICO, some new form of social capital currency of value to those users.</p><p>This is not the only way a social network can achieve success. As noted before, you can build a network based around utility or entertainment. However, the addition of status helps us to explain why some networks which seemingly offer little in the way of meaningful utility (is a service that forces you to make only a six second video useful?) still achieve traction.</p><h3>Facebook's Original Proof of Work</h3><p>You might wonder, how did Facebook differentiate itself from MySpace? It started out as mostly a bunch of text status updates, nothing necessarily that innovative.</p><p>In fact, Facebook launched with one of the most famous proof of work hurdles in the world: you had to be a student at Harvard. By requiring a <a href=\"http://harvard.edu\">harvard.edu</a> email address, Facebook drafted off of one of the most elite cultural filters in the world. It's hard to think of many more powerful slingshots of elitism.</p><p>By rolling out, first to Ivy League schools, then to colleges in general, Facebook scaled while maintaining a narrow age dispersion and exclusivity based around educational credentials.</p><p>Layer that on top of the broader social status game of stalking attractive members of the other sex that animates much of college life and Facebook was a service that tapped into reserves of some of the most heated social capital competitions in the world.</p><h3>Social Capital ROI</h3><p>If a person posts something interesting to a platform, how quickly do they gain likes and comments and reactions and followers? The second tenet is that people seek out the most efficient path to maximize their social capital. To do so, they must have a sense for how different strategies vary in effectiveness. Most humans seem to excel at this.</p><p>Young people, with their much higher usage rate on social media, are the most sensitive and attuned demographic to the payback period and ROI on their social media labor. So, for example, young people tend not to like Twitter but do enjoy Instagram.</p><p>It's not that Twitter doesn't dole out the occasional viral supernova; every so often someone composes a tweet that goes over 1K and then 10K likes or retweets (Twitter should allow people to buy a framed print of said tweet with a silver or gold 1K club or 10K club designation to supplement its monetization). But it’s not common, and most tweets are barely seen by anyone at all. Pair that with the fact that young people's bias towards and skill advantage in visual mediums over textual ones and it's not surprising Instagram is their  social battleground of preference (video games might be the most lucrative battleground for the young if you broaden your definition of social networks, and that's entirely reasonable, though that arena skews male).</p><p>Instagram, despite not having any official reshare option, allows near unlimited hashtag spamming, and that allows for more deterministic, self-generated distribution. Twitter also isn't as great for spreading visual memes because of its stubborn attachment to cropping photos to maintain a certain level of tweet density per phone screen.</p><p>The gradient of your network's social capital ROI can often govern your market share among different demographics. Young girls flocked to Musical.ly in its early days because they were uniquely good at the lip synch dance routine videos that were its bread and butter. In this age of neverending notifications, heavy social media users are hyper aware of differing status ROI among the apps they use. </p><p>I can still remember posting the same photos to Flickr and Instagram for a while and seeing how quickly the latter passed the former in feedback. If I were an investor or even an employee, I might have something like a representative basket of content that I'd post from various test accounts on different social media networks just to track social capital interest rates and liquidity among the various services.</p><p>Some features can increase the reach of content on any network. A reshare option like the retweet button is a massive accelerant of virality on apps where the social graph determines what makes it into the feed. In an effort to increase engagement, Twitter has, over the years, become more and more aggressive to increase the liquidity of tweets. It now displays tweets that were liked by people you follow, even if they didn't retweet them, and it has populated its search tab with Moments, which, like Instagram's Discover Tab, guesses at other content you might like and provides an endless scroll filled with it.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> is an interesting new player in social media because its default feed, For You, relies on a machine learning algorithm to determine what each user sees; the feed of content from by creators you follow, in contrast, is hidden one pane over. If you are new to TikTok and have just uploaded a great video, the selection algorithm promises to distribute your post much more quickly than if you were on sharing it on a network that relies on the size of your following, which most people have to build up over a long period of time. Conversely, if you come up with one great video but the rest of your work is mediocre, you can't count on continued distribution on TikTok since your followers live mostly in a feed driven by the TikTok algorithm, not their follow graph.</p><p>The result is a feedback loop that is much more tightly wound that that of other social networks, both in the positive and negative direction. Theoretically, if the algorithm is accurate, the content in your feed should correlate most closely to quality of the work and its alignment with your personal interests rather than the drawing from the work of accounts you follow. At a time when Bytedance is spending tens (hundreds?) of millions of marketing dollars in a bid to acquire users in international markets, the rapid ROI on new creators' work is a helpful quality in ensuring they stick around.</p><p>This development is interesting for another reason: graph-based social capital allocation mechanisms can suffer from runaway winner-take-all effects. In essence, some networks reward those who gain a lot of followers early on with so much added exposure that they continue to gain more followers than other users, regardless of whether they've earned it through the quality of their posts. One hypothesis on why social networks tend to lose heat at scale is that this type of old money can't be cleared out, and new money loses the incentive to play the game.</p><p>One of the striking things about Silicon Valley as a region versus East Coast power corridors like Manhattan is its dearth of old money. There are exceptions, but most of the fortunes in the Bay Area are not just new money but freshly minted new money from this current generation of tech. You have some old VC or semiconductor industry fortunes, but most of those people are still alive. </p><p>It's in NYC that you run into multi-generational old money hanging around on the Upper East or West sides of Manhattan, or encounter old wealth being showered around town by young socialites whose source of wealth is simply a fortuitous last name. Trickle down economics works, but often just down the veins of family trees.</p><p>It's not that the existence of old money or old social capital dooms a social network to inevitable stagnation, but a social network should continue to prioritize distribution for the best content, whatever the definition of quality, regardless of the vintage of user producing it. Otherwise a form of social capital inequality sets in, and in the virtual world, where exit costs are much lower than in the real world, new users can easily leave for a new network where their work is more properly rewarded and where status mobility is higher.</p><p>It may be that Silicon Valley never comes to be dominated by old money, and I'd consider that a net positive for the region. I'd rather the most productive new work be rewarded consistently by the marketplace than a bunch of stagnant quasi-monopolies hang on to wealth as they reach bloated scales that aren't conducive to innovation. The same applies to social networks and multi-player video games. As a newbie, how quickly, if you put in the work, are you \"in the game\"? Proof of work should define its own meritocracy.</p><p>The same way many social networks track keystone metrics like time to X followers, they should track the ROI on posts for new users. It's likely a leading metric that governs retention or churn. It’s useful as an investor, or even as a curious onlooker to test a social networks by posting varied content from test accounts to gauge the efficiency and fairness of the distribution algorithm.</p><p>Whatever the mechanisms, social networks must devote a lot of resources to market making between content and the right audience for that content so that users feel sufficient return on their work. Distribution is king, even when, or especially when it allocates social capital.</p><h3>Why copying proof of work is lousy strategy for status-driven networks</h3><p>We often see a new social network copy a successful incumbent but with a minor twist thrown in. In the wake of Facebook’s recent issues, we may see some privacy-first social networks, but we have an endless supply of actual knockoffs to study. <a href=\"http://App.net\">App.net</a> and then Mastodon were two prominent Twitter clones that promised some differentiation but which built themselves on the same general open messaging framework.</p><p>Most of these near clones have and will fail. The reason that matching the basic proof of work hurdle of an Status as a Service incumbent fails is that it generally duplicates the status game that already exists. By definition, if the proof of work is the same, you're not really creating a new status ladder game, and so there isn't a real compelling reason to switch when the new network really has no one in it.</p><p>This isn't to say you can't copy an existing proof of work and succeed. After all, Facebook replaced social networks like MySpace and Friendster that came before it, and in the real world, new money sometimes becomes the new old money. You can build a better status game or create a more valuable form of status. Usually when such displacement occurs, though, it does so along the other dimension of pure utility. </p><p>For example, we have multiple messaging apps that became viable companies just by capturing a particular geographic market through localized network effects. We don't have one messaging app to rule them all in the world, but instead a bunch that have won in particular geographies. After all, the best messaging app in most countries or continents is the one most other people are already using there.</p><p>But in the same market? Copying a proof of work there is a tough road. The first mover advantage is also such that the leader with the dominant graph and the social capital of most value can look at any new features that fast followers launch and pull a reverse copy, grafting them into their more extensive and dominant incumbent graph.</p><p>In China, Tencent is desperate to cool off Bytedance's momentum in the short video space; Douyin is enemy number one. Tencent launched a clone but added a feature which allowed viewers to record a side-by-side video reaction in response to any video. It took about half a second for Bytedance to incorporate that into Douyin, and now it's a popular feature in TikTok the world over. If you can't change the proof of work competition as a challenger, copy and throttle is an effective strategy for the incumbent.</p><p>Not to mention that a wholesale ripoff of another app tends to be frowned upon as poor form. Even in China, with its reputation as the land of loose IP protection, users will tend to post dismissive reviews of blatant copycat apps in app stores. Chinese users may not be as aware of American apps that are knocked off in China, but within China, users don't just jump ship to out-and-out copycat apps. There has to be an incentive to overcome the switching costs, and that applies in China as it does elsewhere.</p><p>A few specifics of note here. I once wrote about social networks that <a href=\"http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2015/9/1/when-the-network-is-mature\">the network's the thing</a>; that is, the composition of the graph once a social network reaches scale is its most unique quality. I would update that today to say that it’s the unique combination of a feature and a specific graph that is any network’s most critical competitive advantage. Copying some network's feature often isn’t sufficient if you can’t also copy its graph, but if you can apply the feature to some unique graph that you earned some other way, it can be a defensible advantage.</p><p>Nothing illustrates this better than Facebook's attempts to win back the young from Snapchat by copying some of the network's ephemeral messaging features, or Facebook's attempt to copy TikTok with Lasso, or, well Facebook's attempt to duplicate just about every social app with any traction anywhere. The problem with copying Snapchat is that, well, the reason young people left Facebook for Snapchat was in large part because their parents had invaded Facebook. You don't leave a party with your classmates to go back to one your parents are throwing just because your dad brings in a keg and offer to play beer pong.</p><p>The pairing of Facebook's gigantic graph with just about almost any proof of work from another app changes the very nature of that status game, sometimes in undesirable ways. Do you really want your coworkers and business colleagues and family and friends watching you lip synch to \"It's Getting Hot in Here\" by Nelly on Lasso? Facebook was rumored to be contemplating a special memes tab to try to woo back the young, which, again, completely misunderstands how the young play the meme status game. At last check that plan had been shelved.</p><p>Of course, the canonical Facebook feature grab that pundits often cite as having worked is Instagram's copy of Snapchat's Stories format. As I've written before, I think the Stories format is a genuine innovation on the social modesty problem of social networks. That is, all but the most egregious showoffs feel squeamish about publishing too much to their followers. Stories, by putting the onus on the viewer to pull that content, allows everyone to publish away guilt-free, without regard for the craft that regular posts demand in the ever escalating game that is life publishing. In a world where algorithmic feeds break up your sequence of posts, Stories also allow gifted creators to create sequential narratives.</p><p>Thus Stories is inherently about lowering the publishing hurdle for users and about a new method of storytelling, and any multi-sided network seeing declining growth will try grafting it on their own network at some point just to see if it solves supply-side social modesty.</p><p>Ironically, as services add more and more filters and capabilities into their story functionality, we see the proof of work game in Stories escalating. Many of the Instagram Stories today are more elaborate and time-consuming to publish than regular posts; the variety of filters and stickers and GIFs and other tools in the Stories composer dwarfs the limited filters available for regular Instagram posts. What began as a lighter weight posting format is now a more sophisticated and complex one.</p><p>You can take the monkey out of the status-seeking game, but you can't take the status-seeking out of the monkey.</p><h3>The Greatest Social Capital Creation Event in Tech History</h3><p>In the annals of tech, and perhaps the world, the event that created the greatest social capital boom in history was the launch of Facebook's News Feed.</p><p>Before News Feed, if you were on, say MySpace, or even on a Facebook before News Feed launched, you had to browse around to find all the activity in your network. Only a demographic of a particular age will recall having to click from one profile to another on MySpace while stalking one’s friends. It almost seems comical in hindsight, that we'd impose such a heavy UI burden on social media users. Can you imagine if, to see all the new photos posted in your Instagram network, you had to click through each profile one by one to see if they’d posted any new photos? I feel like my parents talking about how they had to walk miles to grade school through winter snow wearing moccasins of tree bark when I complain about the undue burden of social media browsing before the News Feed, but it truly was a monumental pain in the ass.</p><p>By merging all updates from all the accounts you followed into a single continuous surface and having that serve as the default screen, Facebook News Feed simultaneously increased the efficiency of distribution of new posts and pitted all such posts against each other in what was effectively a single giant attention arena, complete with live updating scoreboards on each post. It was as if the panopticon inverted itself overnight, as if a giant spotlight turned on and suddenly all of us performing on Facebook for approval realized we were all in the same auditorium, on one large, connected infinite stage, singing karaoke to the same audience at the same time.</p><p>It's difficult to overstate what a momentous sea change it was for hundreds of millions, and eventually billions, of humans who had grown up competing for status in small tribes, to suddenly be dropped into a talent show competing against EVERY PERSON THEY HAD EVER MET.</p><p>Predictably, everything exploded. The number of posts increased. The engagement with said posts increased. This is the scene in a movie in which, having launched something, a bunch of people stand in a large open war room waiting, and suddenly a geek staring at a computer goes wide-eyed, exclaiming, \"Oh my god.\" And then the senior ranking officer in the room (probably played by a scowling Ed Harris or Kyle Chandler) walks over to look at the screen, where some visible counter is incrementing so rapidly that the absolute number of digits starts is incrementing in real time as you look at it, because films have to make a plot development like this brain dead obvious to the audience. And then the room erupts in cheers while different people hug and clap each others on the back, and one random extra sprints across the screen in the background, shaking a bottle of champagne that explodes and ejaculates a stream of frothy bubbly through the air like some capitalist money shot that inspires, later, a 2,000 word essay from Žižek.</p><p>Of course, users complained about News Feed at first, but their behavior belied their words, something that would come to haunt Facebook later when it took it as proof that users would always just cry wolf and that similar changes in the future would be the right move regardless of public objections.</p><p>Back in those more halcyon times, though, News Feed unleashed a gold rush for social capital accumulation. Wow, that post over there has ten times the likes that my latest does! Okay, what can I learn from it to use in my next post? Which of my content is driving the most likes? We talk about the miracles of machine learning in the modern age, but as social creatures, humans are no less remarkable in their ability to decipher and internalize what plays well to the peanut gallery.</p><p>Stories of teens A/B testing Instagram posts, yanking those which don't earn enough likes in the first hour, are almost beyond satire; a show like Black Mirror often just resorts to episodes that show things that have already happened in reality. The key component of the 10,000 hour rule of expertise is the idea of deliberate practice, the type that provides immediate feedback. Social media may not be literally real-time in its feedback, but it's close enough, and the scope of reach is magnitudes of order beyond that of any social performance arena in history. We have a generation now that has been trained through hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of social media reps on what engages people on which platforms. In our own way, we are all Buzzfeed. We are all Kardashians.</p><p>The tighter the feedback loop, the quicker the adaptation. Compare early Twitter to modern Twitter; it's like going from listening to your coworkers at a karaoke bar to watching Beyonce play Coachella. I wrote once that any Twitter account that gained enough followers would end up sounding like a fortune cookie, but I underestimated how quickly everyone would arrive at that end state.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The rhetorical style of any Twitter account that continues to gain followers converges on that of a fortune cookie.</p>— Eugene Wei (@eugenewei) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/998714814749802496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2018</a></blockquote>\n",
      "<p>As people start following more and more accounts on a social network, they reach a point where the number of candidate stories exceeds their capacity to see them all. Even before that point, the sheer signal-to-noise ratio may decline to the point that it affects engagement. Almost any network that hits this inflection point turns to the same solution: an algorithmic feed.</p><p>Remember, status derives value from some  type of scarcity. What is the one fundamental scarcity in the age of abundance? User attention. The launch of an algorithmic feed raises the stakes of the social media game. Even if someone follows you, they might no longer see every one of your posts. As DiCaprio said in Django Unchained, “You had my curiosity, but now, under the algorithmic feed, you have to earn my attention.”</p><p>As humans, we intuitively understand that some galling percentage of our happiness with our own status is relative. What matters is less our absolute status than how are we doing compared to those around us. By taking the scope of our status competitions virtual, we scaled them up in a way that we weren't entirely prepared for. Is it any surprise that seeing other people signaling so hard about how wonderful their lives are decreases our happiness?</p><p>As evidence of how anomalous a change this has been for humanity, witness how many celebrities continue to be caught with a history of offensive social media posts that should obviously have been taken down long ago given shifting sensibilities? Kevin Hart, baseball players like Josh Hader, Trea Turner, and Sean Newcomb, and a litany of other public figures and their management teams didn't think to go back and scrub some of their earlier social media posts despite nothing but downside optionality.</p><p>Could social networks have chosen to keep likes and other such metrics about posts private, visible only to the recipient? Could we have kept this social capital arms race from escalating? Some tech CEO's now look back and, like Alan Greenspan, bemoan the irrational exuberance that led us to where we are now, but let's be honest, the incentives to lower interest rates on social capital in all these networks, given their goals and those of their investors, were just too great. If one company hadn’t flooded the market with status, others would have filled the void many times over.</p><p>A social network like Path attempted to limit your social graph size to the Dunbar number, capping your social capital accumulation potential and capping the distribution of your posts. The exchange, they hoped, was some greater transparency, more genuine self-expression. The anti-Facebook. Unfortunately, as social capital theory might predict, Path did indeed succeed in becoming the anti-Facebook: a network without enough users. Some businesses work best at scale, and if you believe that people want to accumulate social capital as efficiently as possible, putting a bound on how much they can earn is a challenging business model, as dark as that may be.</p><h3>Why Social Capital Accumulation Skews Young</h3><p>I'd love to see a graph of social capital assets under management by user demographic. I'd wager that we'd see that young people, especially those from their teens, when kids seem to be given their first cell phones, through early 20's, are those who dominate the game. My nephew can post a photo of his elbow on Instagram and accumulate a couple hundred likes; I could share a photo of myself in a conga line with Barack Obama and Beyonce while Jennifer Lawrence sits on my shoulders pouring Cristal over my head and still only muster a fraction of the likes my nephew does posting a photo of his elbow. It's a young person's game, and the Livejournal/Blogger/Flickr/Friendster/MySpace era in which I came of age feels like the precambrian era of social in comparison.</p><p>While we're all status-seeking monkeys, young people tend to be the tip of the spear when it comes to catapulting new Status as a Service businesses, and may always will be. A brief aside here on why this tends to hold.</p><p>One is that older people tend to have built up more stores of social capital. A job title, a spouse, maybe children, often a house or some piece of real estate, maybe a car, furniture that doesn't require you to assemble it on your own, a curriculum vitae, one or more college degrees, and so on. </p><p>[This differs by culture, of course. In the U.S., where I grew up, one’s job is the single most important status carrier which is why so many conversations there begin with “What do you do?”]</p><p>Young people are generally social capital poor unless they've lucked into a fat inheritance. They have no job title, they may not have finished college, they own few assets like homes and cars, and often if they've finished college they're saddled with substantial school debt. For them, the fastest and most efficient path to gaining social capital, while they wait to level up enough to win at more grown-up games like office politics, is to ply their trade on social media (or video games, but that’s a topic for another day).</p><p>Secondly, because of their previously accumulated social capital, adults tend to have more efficient means of accumulating even more status than playing around online. Maintenance of existing social capital stores is often a more efficient use of time than fighting to earn more on a new social network given the ease of just earning interest on your sizeable status reserves. That's just math, especially once you factor in loss aversion.</p><p>Young people look at so many of the status games of older folks—what brand of car is parked in your garage, what neighborhood can you afford to live in, how many levels below CEO are you in your org—and then look at apps like Vine and Musical.ly, and they choose the only real viable and thus optimal path before them. Remember the second tenet: people maximize their social capital the most efficient way possible. Both the young and old pursue optimal strategies.</p><p>That so much social capital for the young comes in the form of followers, likes, and comments from peers and strangers shouldn't lessen its value. Think back to your teen years and try to recall any real social capital that you could accumulate on such a scale. In your youth, the approval of peers and others in your demographic tend to matter more than just about anything, and social media has extended the reach of the youth status game in just about every direction possible.</p><p>Furthermore, old people tend to be hesitant about mastering new skills in general, including new status games, especially if they involve bewildering new technology. There are many reasons, including having to worry about raising children and other such adult responsibilities and just plain old decay in neural malleability. Perhaps old dogs don't learn new tricks because they are closer to death, and the period to earn a positive return on that investment is shorter. At some point, it's not worth learning any new tricks at all, and we all turn into the brusque old lady in every TV show, e.g. Maggie Smith in Downton Abbey, dropping withering quips about the follies of humanity all about us. I look forward to this period of my life when, through the unavoidable spectre of mortality, I will naturally settle into my DGAF phase of courageous truth-telling.</p><p>Lastly, young people  have a surplus of something which most adults always complain they have too little of: time. The hurdle rate on the time of the young is low, and so they can afford to spend some of that surplus exploring new social networks, mining them to see if the social capital returns are attractive, whereas most adults can afford to wait until a network has runaway product-market fit to jump in. The young respond to all the status games of the world with a consistent refrain: \"If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Among those are the dexterity and coordination to lip synch to songs while dancing Blocboy JB's Shoot in my bedroom, and the time to do it over and over again until I nail it\" (I wrote this long before recent events in which Liam Neeson lit much of his social capital on fire, vacating the “wronged and vengeful father with incredible combat and firearms skills” role to the next aging male star).</p><p>These modern forms of social capital are like new money. Not surprisingly, then, older folks, who are worse at accumulating these new badges than the young, often scoff at those kids wasting time on those apps, just as old money from the Upper West and Upper East Sides of New York look down their noses at those hoodie-wearing new money billionaire philistines of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The exception might be those who grew up in this first golden age of social media. For some of this generation’s younger NBA players, who were on Instagram from the time they got their first phone, posting may be second nature, a force of habit they bring with them into the league. Witness how many young NBA stars track their own appearances on House of Highlights the way stars of old hoped looked for themselves on Sportscenter. </p><p>If this generational divide on social media between the old and the young was simply a one-time anomaly given the recent birth of social networks, and if future generations will be virtual status-seeking experts for womb to tomb, then capturing users in their formative social media years becomes even more critical for social networks.</p><h3>“I contain multitudes” (said the youngblood)</h3><p>Incidentally, teens and twenty-somethings, more so than the middle-aged and elderly, tend to juggle more identities. In middle and high school, kids have to maintain an identity among classmates at school, then another identity at home with family. Twenty-somethings craft one identity among coworkers during the day, then another among their friends outside of work. Often those spheres have differing status games, and there is some penalty to merging those identities. Anyone who has ever sent a text meant for their schoolmates to their parents, or emailed a boss or coworker something meant for their happy hour crew knows the treacherous nature of context collapse.</p><p>Add to that this younger generation's preference for and facility with visual communication and it's clearly why the preferred social network of the young is Instagram and the preferred messenger Snapchat, both preferable to Facebook. Instagram because of the ease of creating multiple accounts to match one's portfolio of identities, Snapchat for its best in class ease of visual messaging privately to particular recipients. The expiration of content, whether explicitly executed on Instagram (you can easily kill off a meme account after you've outgrown it, for example), or automatically handled on a service like Snapchat, is a must-have feature for those for whom multiple identity management is a fact of life.</p><p>Facebook, with its explicit attachment to the real world graph and its enforcement of a single public identity, is just a poor structural fit for the more complex social capital requirements of the young.</p><h3>Common Social Network Arcs</h3><p>It's useful to look at some of the common paths that social networks traverse over time using our two axis model. Not all of them took the same paths to prominence. Doing so also helps illuminate the most productive strategies for each to pursue future growth. </p><p><strong>First utility, then social capital</strong></p>\n",

      "<p>Of course, the competitive context matters. Facebook faced much stiffer competition in these categories than WeChat did; for Facebook to build a better mousetrap in any of these, the requirements were much higher than for WeChat.</p><p>Take payments for example. The Chinese largely skipped credit cards, for a whole host of reasons. In part it was due to a cultural aversion to debt, in part because Visa, Mastercard, and American Express weren’t allowed into China where they would certainly have marketed their cards as aggressively as they always do. That meant Alipay and WePay launched competing primarily with cash and all its familiar inconveniences. Compare that to, say, Apple Pay trying to displace the habit of pulling out a credit card in the U.S., especially given how so many people are addicted to credit card points and miles (airline frequent flier programs being another testament to the power of status to influence people’s decision-making).</p><p>Making a real dent in new categories like commerce and payments will require a long-term mindset and a ton of resources on the part of Facebook and its subsidiaries like WhatsApp and Instagram. Past efforts to, for example, improve Facebook search, position Facebook as payment option, and introduce virtual assistants on Messenger seem to have been abandoned. Will new efforts like Facebook's cryptocurrency effort or Instagram's push into commerce be given a sufficiently long leash?</p><h3>Social Network Asymptote 1: Proof of Work</h3><p>How do you tell when a Status as a Service business will stop growing? What causes networks to suddenly hit that dreaded upper shoulder in the S-curve if, according to Metcalfe's Law, the value of a network grows in proportion to the square of its users? What are the missing variables that explain why networks don’t keep growing until they’ve captured everyone?</p><p>The reasons are numerous, let’s focus on social capital theory. To return to our cryptocurrency analogy, the choice of your proof of work is by definition an <a href=\"http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes\" target=\"_blank\">asymptote</a> because the skills it selects for are not evenly distributed.</p><p>To take a specific example, since it's the app du jour, let's look at the app formerly known as Musical.ly, TikTok.</p><p>You've probably watched a TikTok video, but have you tried to make one? My guess is that many of you have not and never will (but if you have, please send me a link). This is no judgment, I haven’t either.</p><p>You may possess, in your estimation, too much self-dignity to wallow in cringe. Your arthritic joints may not be capable of executing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSZFnOjuw5U\" target=\"_blank\">Orange Justice</a>. Whatever the reason, TikTok's creator community is ultimately capped by the nature of its proof of work, no matter how ingenious its creative tools. The same is true of Twitter: the number of people who enjoy crafting witty 140 and now 280-character info nuggets is finite. Every network has some ceiling on its ultimate number of contributors, and it is often a direct function of its proof of work.</p><p>Of course, the value and total user size of a network is not just a direct function of its contributor count. Whether you believe in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)\">1/9/90 rule</a> of social networks or not, it’s directionally true that any network has value to people besides its creators. In fact, for almost every network, the number of lurkers far exceeds the number of active participants. Life may not be a spectator sport, but a lot of social media is.</p><p>This isn’t to say that proof of work is bad. In fact, coming up with a constraint that unlocks the creativity of so many people is exactly how Status as a Service businesses achieve product-market fit. Constraints force the type of compression that often begets artistic elegance, and forcing creatives to grapple with a constraint can foster the type of focused exertion that totally unconstrained exploration fails to inspire.</p><p>Still, a ceiling is a ceiling. If you want to know the terminal value of a network, the type of proof of work is a key variable to consider. If you want to know why Musical.ly stopped growing and sold to Bytedance, why Douyin will hit a ceiling of users in China (if it hasn’t already), or what the cap of active users is for any social network, first ask yourself how many people have the skill and interest to compete in that arena.</p><h3>Social Network Asymptote 2: Social Capital Inflation and Devaluation</h3><p>More terrifying to investors and employees than an asymptote is collapse. Recall the cautionary myth of the fall of Myspace, named after the little known Greek god of vanity Myspakos (Editor’s note: I made that up, it’s actually Narcissus). Why do some social networks, given Metcalfe's Law and its related network effects theories, not only stop growing but even worse, contract and wither away?</p><p>To understand the inherent fragility in Status as a Service businesses, we need to understand the volatility of status.</p><h3>Social Capital Interest Rate Hikes</h3><p>One of the common traps is the winner's curse for social media. If a social network achieves enough success, it grows to a size that requires the imposition of an algorithmic feed in order to maintain high signal-to-noise for most of its users. It's akin to the Fed trying to manage inflation by raising interest rates.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that this now diminishes the distribution of any single post from any single user. One of the most controversial of such decisions was Facebook's change to dampen how much content from Pages would be distributed into the News Feed.</p><p>Many institutions, especially news outlets, had turned to Facebook to access some sweet sweet eyeball inventory in News Feeds. They devised all sorts of giveaways and promotions to entice people to follow their Facebook Pages. After gaining followers, a media company had a free license to publish and publish often into their News Feeds, an attractive proposition considering users were opening Facebook multiples times per day. For media companies, who were already struggling to grapple with all the chaos the internet had unleashed on their business models, this felt like upgrading from waving stories at passersby on the street to stapling stories to the inside of eyelids the world over, several times a day. Deterministic, guaranteed eyeballs.</p><p>Then, one day, Facebook snapped its fingers like Thanos and much of that dependable reach evaporated into ash. No longer would every one of your Page followers see every one of your posts. Facebook did what central banks do to combat inflation and raised interest rates on borrowing attention from the News Feed.</p><p>Was such a move inevitable? Not necessarily, but it was always likely. That’s because there is one scarce resource which is a natural limit on every social network and media company today, and that is user attention. That a social network shares some of that attention with its partners will always be secondary to accumulating and retaining that attention in the first place. Facebook, for example, must always guard against the tragedy of the commons when it comes to News Feed. Saving media institutions is a secondary consideration, if that.</p><h3>Social Capital Deflation: Scarcity Precarity or the Groucho Marx Conundrum</h3><p>Another existential risk that is somewhat unique to social networks is this: network effects are powerful, but ones which are social in nature have the unfortunate quality of being just as ferocious in reverse.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TOC3fE\">High Growth Handbook</a> by Elad Gil, Marc Andreessen notes:</p><blockquote><p>I think network effects are great, but in a sense they’re a little overrated. The problem with network effects is they unwind just as fast. And so they’re great while they last, but when they reverse, they reverse viciously. Go ask the MySpace guys how their network effect is going. Network effects can create a very strong position, for obvious reasons. But in another sense, it’s a very weak position to be in. Because if it cracks, you just unravel. I always worry when a company thinks the answer is just network effects. How durable are they?</p></blockquote><p>Why do social network effects reverse? Utility, the other axis by which I judge social networks, tends to be uncapped in value. It's rare to describe a product or service as having become too useful. That is, it's hard to over-serve on utility. The more people that accept a form of payment, the more useful it is, like Visa or Mastercard or Alipay. People don’t stop using a service because it’s too useful.</p><p>Social network effects are different. If you've lived in New York City, you've likely seen, over and over, night clubs which are so hot for months suddenly go out of business just a short while later. Many types of social capital have qualities which render them fragile. Status relies on coordinated consensus to define the scarcity that determines its value. Consensus can shift in an instant. Recall the friend in Swingers, who, at every crowded LA party, quips, \"This place is dead anyway.\" Or recall the wise words of noted sociologist Groucho Marx: \"I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.\"</p><p>The Groucho Marx effect doesn't take effect immediately. In the beginning, a status hierarchy requires lower status people to join so that the higher status people have a sense of just how far above the masses they reside. It's silly to order bottle service at Hakkasan in Las Vegas if no one is sitting on the opposite side of the velvet ropes; a leaderboard with just a single high score is meaningless.</p><p>However, there is some tipping point of popularity beyond which a restaurant, club, or social network can lose its cool. When Malcolm Gladwell inserted the term \"tipping point\" into popular vernacular, he didn't specify which way things were tipping. We tend to glamorize the tipping into rapid diffusion, the toe of the S-curve, but in status games like fashion the arc of popularity traces not an S-curve but a bell curve. At the top of that bell curve, you reach the less glamorous tipping point, the one before the plummet.</p><p>When the definition of status is distributed, often one minority has disproportionate sway. If that group, the cool kids, pulls the ripcord, everyone tends to follow them to the exits. In fact, it’s usually the most high status or desirable people who leave first, the <a href=\"http://blog.bumblebeelabs.com/?p=1207\" target=\"_blank\">evaporative cooling effect</a> of social networks. At that point, that product or service better have moved as far out as possible on the utility axis or the velocity of churn can cause a nose bleed.</p><p>[Mimetic desire is a cruel mistress. Girard would've had a field day with the Fyre Festival. Congratulations Billy McFarland, you are the ritual sacrifice with which we cleanse ourselves of the sin of coveting thy influencer’s bounty.]</p><p>Fashion is one of the most interesting industries for having understood this recurring boom and bust pattern in network effects and taken ownership of its own status devaluation cycles. Some strange cabal of magazine editors and fashion designers decide each season to declare arbitrarily new styles the fashion of the moment, retiring previous recommendations before they grow stale. There is usually no real utility change at all; functionally, the shirt you buy this season doesn’t do anything the shirt you bought last season still can’t do equally well. The industry as a whole is simply pulling the frontier of scarcity forward like a wave we're all trying to surf.</p><p>This season, the color of the moment might be saffron. Why? Because someone cooler than me said so. Tech tends to prioritize growth at all costs given the non-rival, zero marginal cost qualities of digital information. In a world of abundance, that makes sense. However, technology still has much to learn from industries like fashion about how to proactively manage scarcity, which is important when goods are rivalrous. Since many types of status are relative, it is, by definition, rivalrous. There is some equivalent of crop rotation theory which applies to social networks, but it's not part of the standard tech playbook yet.</p><p>A variant of this type of status devaluation cascade can be triggered when a particular group joins up. This is because the stability of a status lattice depends just as much on the composition of the network as its total size. A canonical example in tech was the youth migration out of Facebook when their parents signed on in force. Because of the incredible efficiency of News Feed distribution, Facebook became a de facto surveillance apparatus for the young: Mommy and Daddy are watching, as well as future universities and employers and dates who will time travel back and scour your profile someday. As Facebook became less attractive as a platform for the young, many of them flocked to Snapchat as their new messaging solution, its ephemeral nature offering built-in security and its UX opacity acting as a gate against clueless seniors.</p><p>I've written before about Snapchat's famously opaque Easter Egg UI as a sort of tamper-proof lid for parents, but if we combine social network utility theory with my post on <a href=\"http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/9/14/selfies-as-a-second-language\">selfies as a second language</a>, it's also clear that Snapchat is a suboptimal messaging platform for older people whose preferred medium of communication remains text. Snapchat opens to a camera. If you want to text someone, it's extra work to swipe to the left pane to reach the text messaging screen.</p><p>I would be shocked if Facebook did not, at one point, contemplate a version of its app that opened to the camera first, instead of the News Feed, considering how many odd clones of other apps it’s considered in the past. If so, it’s good they never shipped it, because for young people, publishing to a graph that still contained their parents would've still been prohibitive, while for old folks who aren't as biased towards visual mediums, such a UI would've been suboptimal. It would've been a disastrous lose-lose for Facebook.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">On network effect traps: <a href=\"https://t.co/l66ruYps7e\">https://t.co/l66ruYps7e</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kDADIBOwcU\">pic.twitter.com/kDADIBOwcU</a></p>— Patrick Collison (@patrickc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1096653895600762881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2019</a></blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Patrick Collison linked to an interesting <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1248.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> (PDF) on network effects traps in the physical world. They exist in the virtual world as well, and Status as a Service businesses are particularly fraught with them. Another instance is path dependent user composition. A fervent early adopter group can define who a new social network seems to be for, merely by flooding the service with content they love. Before concerted efforts to personalize the front page more quickly, Pinterest seemed like a service targeted mostly towards women even though its basic toolset are useful to many men as well. Because a new user’s front page usually drew upon pins from their friends already on the service, the earliest cohorts, which leaned female, dominated most new user’s feeds. My earliest Pinterest homepage was an endless collage of makeup, women’s clothing, and home decor because those happened to be some of the things my friends were pinning for a variety of projects.</p><p>Groucho Marx was ahead of his time as a social capital philosopher, but we can build upon his work. To his famous aphorism we should add some variants. When it comes to evaporative cooling, two come to mind: “I don’t want to belong to any club that will have those people as a member” and “I don’t want to belong to any club that those people don’t want to be a member of.”</p><h3>Mitigating Social Capital Devaluation Risk, and the Snapchat Strategy</h3><p>In a leaked <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/media/snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-company-memo-on-2019-strategic-goals-and-profitability\">memo</a> late last year, Evan Spiegel wrote about how one of the core values of Snapchat is to make it the fastest way to communicate.</p><blockquote><p>The most durable way for us to grow is by relentlessly focusing on being the fastest way to communicate.</p><p>Recently I had the opportunity to use Snapchat v5.0 on an iPhone 4. It had much of Bobby's original code in many of my original graphics. It was way faster than the current version of Snapchat running on my iPhone X.</p><p>In our excitement to innovate and bring many new products into the world, we have lost the core of what made Snapchat the fastest way to communicate.</p><p>In 2019, we will refocus our company on making Snapchat the fastest way to communicate so that we can unlock the core value of our service for the billions of people who have not yet learned how to use Snapchat. If we aren't able to unlock the core value of Snapchat, we won't ever be able to unlock the full power of our camera.</p><p>This will require us to change the way that we work and put our core product value of being the fastest way to communicate at the forefront of everything we do at Snap. It might require us to change our products for different markets where some of our value-add features detract from our core product value.</p></blockquote><p>This clarifies Snapchat's strategy on the 3 axes of my social media framework: Snapchat intends to push out further on the utility axis at the expense of the social capital axis which, as we’ve noted before, is volatile ground to build a long-term business on.</p><p>Many will say, especially Snapchat itself, that it has been the anti-Facebook all along. Because it has no likes, it liberates people from destructive status games. To believe that is to underestimate the ingenuity of humanity in its ability to weaponize any network for status games.</p><p>Anyone who has studied kids using Snapchat know that it's just as integral a part of high school status and FOMO wars as Facebook, and arguably more so now that those kids largely don’t use Facebook. The only other social media app that is as sharp a stick is Instagram which has, it’s true, more overt social capital accumulation mechanisms. Still, the idea that kids use Snapchat like some pure messaging utility is laughable and makes me wonder if people have forgotten what teenage school life was like. Whether you see people attend a party that you’re not invited to on Instagram or on someone’s Snap, you still feel terrible.</p><p>Remember Snapchat's original Best Friends list? I'm going to guess many of my readers don't, because, as noted earlier, old people probably didn't play that status game, if they'd even figured out how to use Snapchat by that point. This was just about as pure a status game feature as could be engineered for teens. Not only did it show the top three people you Snapped with most frequently, you could look at who the top three best friends were for any of your contacts. Essentially, it made the hierarchy of everyone's “friendships” public, making the popularity scoreboard explicit.</p>\n",

      "<p>If you and a friend Snap back and forth for consecutive days, you build up a streak which is tracked in your friends list. Young people quickly threw their heart and souls into building and maintaining streaks with their friends. This was literally proof of work as proof of friendship, quantified and tracked.</p><p>Streaks, of course, have the wonderful quality of being unbounded. You can maintain as many streaks as you like. If you don't think social capital has value, you've never seen, as I have, a young person sobbing over having to go on vacation without their phone, or to somewhere without cell or wifi access, only to see all their streaks broken. Some kids have resorted, when forced to go abroad on a vacation, to leaving their phone with a friend who helps to keep all the streaks alive, like some sort of social capital babysitter or surrogate.</p><p>What's hilarious is how efficiently young people maintain streaks. It's a daily ritual that often consists of just quickly running down your friend list and snapping something random, anything, just to increment the streak count. My nephew often didn’t even bother framing the camera up, most his streak-maintenance snaps were blurry pics of the side of his elbow, half his shoulder, things like that.</p><p>Of course, as evidence of the fragility of social capital structures, streaks have started to lose heat. Many younger users of Snapchat no longer bother with them. Maintaining social capital games is always going to be a volatile game, prone to sudden and massive deflationary events, but while they work, they’re a hell of a drug. They also can be useful; for someone Snapping frequently, like all teens do, having a best friends list sorted to the top of your distribution list is a huge time-saver. Social capital and utility often can’t be separated cleanly.</p><p>Still, given the precarious nature of status, and given the existence of Instagram which has always been a more unabashed social capital accumulation service, it’s not a bad strategy for Snapchat to push out towards increased utility in messaging instead. The challenge, as anyone competing in the messaging space knows, is that creating any durable utility advantage is brutally hard. In the game theory of tech competition, it's best to assume that any feature that can be copied will. And messaging may never be, from a profit perspective, the most lucrative of businesses.</p><p>As a footnote, Snapchat is also playing on the entertainment axis with its Discover pane. Almost all social networks of some scale will play with some mix of social capital, utility, and entertainment, but each chooses how much to emphasize each dimension.</p><h3>Lengthening the Half-life of Status Games</h3><p>The danger of having a proof of work burden that doesn't change is that eventually, everyone who wants to mine for that social currency will have done so, and most of it will be depleted. At that point, the amount of status-driven potential energy left in the social network flattens. If, at that inflection, the service hasn't made headway in adding a lot of utility, the network can go stale.</p><p>One way to combat this, which the largest social networks tend to do better than others, is add new forms of proof of work which effectively create a new reserve of potential social capital for users to chase. Instagram began with square photos and filters; it's since removed the aspect ratio constraint, added video, lengthened video limits, and added formats like Boomerang and Stories. Its parent company, Facebook, arguably has broadened the most of any social network in the world, going from a text-based status update tool for a bunch of Harvard students to a social network with so many formats and options that I can’t keep track of them all. These new hurdles are like downloadable content in video games, new levels to spice up a familiar game.</p><p>Doing so is a delicate balance, because it’s quite possible that Facebook is so many things to so many people that it isn't really anything to anyone anymore. It is hard to be a club that admits everyone but still wants to offer a coherent status ladder. You can argue Facebook doesn't want to be in the status game, but if so, it had better add a lot more utility.</p><p>Video games illuminate the proof of work cycle better than almost any category, it is the drosophila of this type of analysis given its rapid life cycle and overt skill-versus-reward tradeoffs. Why is it, for example, that big hit games tend to have a life cycle of about 18 months?</p><p>A new game offers a whole new set of levels and challenges, and players jump into the status competition with gusto. But, eventually, skill differentiation tends to sort the player base cleanly. Players rise to the level of their mastery and plateau. Simultaneously, players become overly familiar with the game's challenges; the dopamine hit of accomplishment dissipates. </p><p>A franchise like, say, Call of Duty, learns to manage this cycle by investing hundreds of millions of dollars to issue a new version of the game regularly. Each game offers familiarity but a new set of levels and challenges and environments. It's the circle of life.</p><p>Some games can lengthen the cycle. For example, casino games in Vegas pay real money to set an attractive floor on the ROI of playing. Some MMORPGs offer other benefits to players, like a sense of community, which last longer than the pure skill challenge of playing the game. Looking at some of the longer lasting video game franchises like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Fortnite reveal a lot about how a parallel industry has succeeded in lengthening the productive middle age of its top properties.</p><p>I suspect the frontier of social network strategy will draw more and more upon deep study of these adjacent and much older social capital games. Fashion, video games, religion, and society itself are some of the original Status as a Service businesses.</p><h3>Why Some Companies Will Always Struggle with Social</h3><p>Some people find status games distasteful. Despite this, everyone I know is engaged in multiple status games. Some people sneer at people hashtag spamming on Instagram, but then retweet praise on Twitter. Others roll their eyes at photo albums of expensive meals on Facebook but then submit research papers to prestigious journals in the hopes of being published. Parents show off photos of their children performances at recitals, people preen in the mirror while assessing their outfits, employees flex on their peers in meetings, entrepreneurs complain about 30 under 30 lists while wishing to be on them, reporters check the Techmeme leaderboards; life is nothing if not a nested series of status contests.</p><p>Have I met a few people in my life who are seemingly above all status games? Yes, but they are so few as to be something akin to miracles, and damn them for making the rest of us feel lousy over our vanity. </p><p>The number of people who claim to be above status games exceeds those who actually are. I believe their professed distaste to be genuine, but even if it isn't, the danger of their indignation is that they actually become blind to how their product functions in some ways as Status as a Service business.</p><p>Many of our tech giants, in fact, are probably always going to be weak at social absent executive turnover or smart acquisitions. Take Apple, which has actually tried before at building out social features. They built one in music, but it died off quickly. They've tried to add some social features to the photo album on iOS, though every time I've tried them out I end up more bewildered than anything else.</p><p>iMessages, Apple fans might proclaim! Hundreds of millions of users, a ton of usage among teens, isn't that proof that Apple can do social? Well, in a sense, but mostly one of utility. Apple's social efforts tend to be social capital barren.</p><p>Since Apple positions itself as the leading advocate for user privacy, it will always be constrained on building out social features since many of them trade off against privacy. Not all of them do, and it’s possible a social network based entirely on privacy can be successful, but 1) it would be challenging and 2) it's not clear many people mind trading off some privacy for showing off their best lives online.</p><p>This is, of course, exactly why many people love and choose Apple, and they have more cash than they can spend. No one need feel sorry for Apple, and as is often the case, a company’s strengths and weaknesses stem from the same quality in their nature. I’d rather Apple continue to focus on building the best computers in the world. Still, it’s a false tradeoff to regard Apple’s emphasis on privacy as an excuse for awkward interactions like photo sharing on iOS.</p><p>The same inherent social myopia applies to Google which famously took a crack at building a social network of its own with Google+. Like Apple, the team in Mountain View has always seemed more suited to building out networks of utility rather than social capital. Google is often spoken of as a company where software engineers have the most power. Engineers, in my experience, are driven by logic, and status-centered products are distasteful or mysterious to them, often both. Google will probably always be weak at social, but as with Apple, they compensate with unique strengths.</p><p>Oddly enough, despite controlling one of the two dominant mobile platforms, they have yet to be able to launch a successful messaging app. That’s about as utility-driven a social application as there is, akin to email where Google does have sizeable market share with GMail. It's a shame as Google could probably use social as an added layer of utility in many of their products, especially in Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon and Netflix both launched social efforts though they’ve largely been forgotten. It's likely the attempts were premature, pushed out into the world before either company had sufficient scale to enable positive flywheel effects. It’s hard enough launching a new social network, but it’s even harder to launch social features built around behaviors like shopping or renting DVD’s through the mail which occur  infrequently. Neither company’s social efforts were the most elegantly designed, either (Facebook is underrated for its ability to launch a social product that scaled to billions of users, its design team has a mastery of maintaining ease of use for users of all cultures and ages).</p><p>Given the industrialization of fake reviews, and given how many people have Prime accounts, Amazon could build a social service simply to facilitate product recommendations and reviews from people you know and trust; I increasingly turn a skeptical eye to both extremely positive and negative reviews on Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/124\" target=\"_blank\">even if they are listed as coming from verified purchasers</a>. The key value of a feature like this would be utility, but the status boost from being a product expert would be the energy turning the flywheel. The thing is, Amazon actually has a track record of harnessing social dynamics in service of its retail business with features like reviewer rankings and global sales rank (both are discussed a bit further down).</p><p>As for Netflix, I actually think social isn’t as useful as many would think in generating video recommendations (that’s a discussion for another day, but suffice it to say there is some narcissism of small differences when it comes to film taste). However, as an amplifier of Netflix as the modern water cooler, as a way to encourage herd behavior, social activity can serve as an added layer of buzz that for now is largely opaque to users inside Netflix apps. It's a strategy that is only viable if you can achieve the size of subscriber base that a Netflix has, and thus it is a form of secondary scale advantage that they could leverage more.</p><p>However, there's another reason that senior execs at most companies, even social networks, are ill-suited to designing and leveraging social features. It’s a variant of winner's curse.</p><h3>Let Them Eat Cake</h3><p>You'll hear it again and again, the easiest way to empathize with your users is to be the canonical user yourself. I tend to subscribe to this idea, which is unfortunate because it means I have hundreds of apps installed on my phone at any point in time, just trying to keep up with the product zeitgeist.</p><p>With social networks, one of the problems with seeing your own service through your users’ eyes is that every person has a different experience given who they follow and what the service's algorithm feeds them. When you have hundreds of millions or even billions of users, across different cultures, how do you accurately monitor what's going on? Your metrics may tell you that engagement is high and growing, but what is the composition of that activity, and who is exposed to what parts? </p><p>Until we have metrics that distinguish between healthy and unhealthy activity, social network execs largely have to steer by anecdote, by licking a finger and sticking it in the air to ascertain the direction of the wind. Some may find it hard to believe when execs plead ignorance when alerted of the scope of problems on their services, but I don't. When it comes to running a community, the thickest veil of ignorance is the tidy metrics dashboard that munges hundreds, thousands, or maybe even millions of cohorts into just a handful.</p><p>To really get the sense of a health of a social network, one must understand the topology of the network, and the volume and nature of connections and interactions among hundreds of millions or even billions of users. It’s impossible to process them all, but just as difficult today to summarize them without losing all sorts of critical detail.</p><p>But perhaps even more confounding is that executives at successful social networks are some of the highest status people in the world. Forget first world problems, they have .1% or .001% problems. On a day-to-day basis, they hardly face a single issue that their core users grapple with constantly. Engagement goals may drive them towards building services that are optimized as social capital games, but they themselves are hardly in need of more status, except of a type they won't find on their own networks.</p><p>[The one exception may be Jack Dorsey, as any tweet he posts now attracts an endless stream of angry replies. It’s hard to argue he doesn’t understand firsthand the downside risk of a public messaging protocol. Maybe, for victims of harassment on Twitter, we need a Jack that is less thick-skinned and stoic, not more.]</p><h3>The Social Capital - Financial Capital Exchange</h3><p>[If you fully believe in the existence and value of social capital, you can skip this section, though it may be of interest in understanding some ways to estimate its value.]</p><p>That some of the largest, most valuable companies in history have been built so quickly in part on creating status games should be enough to convince you of the existence and value of social capital. Since we live in the age of social media, we live in perhaps the peak of social capital assets in the history of civilization. However, as noted earlier, one of the challenges of studying it is that we don't have agreed-upon definitions of how to measure it and thus to track its flows.</p><p>I haven't found a clean definition of social capital but think of it as capital that derives from networks of people. If you want to explore the concept further, this <a href=\"https://www.socialcapitalresearch.com/literature/definition/\">page</a> has a long list of definitions from literature. The fact is, I have deep faith in all my readers when it comes to social capital that, like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said about pornography, you \"know it when you see it.\"</p><p>But more than that, the dark matter that is social capital can be detected through those exchanges in which it converts into more familiar stores of value.</p><p>If you've ever borrowed a cup of milk from your neighbor, or relied on them to watch your children for an afternoon, you know the value of social capital. If you lived in an early stage of human history, when people wandered in small nomadic tribes and regularly clubbed people of other tribes to death with sticks and stones, you also know the value of social capital through the protective cocoon of its presence and the sudden violence in its absence.</p><p>Perhaps the easiest way to spot social capital is to look at places where people trade it for financial capital. With the maturing of social networks, we've seen the infrastructure to facilitate these exchanges come a long way. These trades allow us to assign a tangible value to social capital the way one might understand the value of an intangible assets like leveled-up World of Warcraft characters when they are sold on the open market.</p><p>Perhaps the most oft-cited example of a social-to-financial-capital exchange is the type pulled off by influencers on Instagram and YouTube. I've met models who, in another life, might be mugging outside an Abercrombie and Fitch or working the front door at some high end restaurant in Los Angeles, but instead now pull down over 7 figures a year for posting photos of themselves luxuriating in specific resorts, wearing and using products from specific sponsors. When Jake or Logan Paul post a video of themselves preening in front of their new Lamborghini in the driveway of the mansion they bought using money stemming from their YouTube streaming, we know some exchange of social capital for financial capital has occurred upstream. Reshape distribution and you reshape the world.</p><p>Similarly, we see flows the other direction. People buying hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter is one of the cleanest examples of trading financial capital for social capital. Later, that social capital can be converted back into financial capital any number of ways, including charging sponsors for posts. Depending on the relative value in both directions there can be arbitrage.</p><p>[Klout, a much-mocked company online, attempted to more precisely track social capital valuations of people online, but, just as the truly wealthy mock the nouveau riche as gauche, many found the explicit measurement attempts unseemly. Most of these same people, however, compete hard for social capital online, so ¯\\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯. The designation of which status games are acceptable is itself a status game.]</p><p>Asia, where monetization models differ for a variety of cultural and contextual reasons, provides an even cleaner valuation of social capital. There, many social networks allow you to directly turn your social capital into financial capital, without leaving the network. For example, on live-streaming sites like YY, you can earn digital gifts from your viewers which cost actual money, the value of which you split with the platform. In the early days, a lot of YY consisted of cute girls singing pop songs. These days, as seen in the fascinating documentary <a href=\"https://www.desire.film/\" target=\"_blank\">People’s Republic of Desire</a>, it has evolved into much more.</p><p>Agencies have sprung up in China to develop and manage influencers, almost like farm systems in baseball with player development and coaches. The speed at which social capital can be converted into your own branded product lines is accelerating by leaps and bounds, and nowhere more so than in China.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Twitter, if one of your tweets somehow goes massively viral, you still have to attach a follow-up tweet with a link to your GoFundMe page, a  vulgar monetization hack in comparison. It’s China, not the U.S., that is the bleeding edge of influencer industrialization.</p><p>I'm skeptical that all of Asia's monetization schemes will export to the culture in America, but for this post, the important thing is that social capital has real financial value, and networks differ along the spectrum of how easily that exchange can be made.</p><h3>Social Capital Accumulation and Storage</h3><p>As with cryptocurrency, it's no use accumulating social capital if you can't take ownership of it and store it safely. Almost all successful social networks are adept at providing both accumulation and storage mechanisms.</p><p>It may sound obvious now, but consider the many apps and services that failed to provide something like this and saw all their value leak to other social networks. Hipstamatic came before Instagram and was the first photo filter app of note that I used on mobile. But, unlike Instagram, it charged for its filters and had no profile pages, social network, or feed. I used Hipstamatic filters to modify my iPhone photos and then posted them to other social networks like Facebook. Hipstamatic provided utility but captured none of the social capital that came from the use of its filters.</p><p>Contrast this with a company like Musical.ly, which I mentioned above. They came up with a unique proof of work burden, but unlike Hipstamatic, they wanted to capture the value of the social capital that its users would mine by creating their musical skits. They didn't want these skits to just be uploaded to Instagram or Facebook or other networks.</p><p>Therefore, they created a feed within the app, to give its best users distribution for their work. By doing so, Musical.ly owned that social capital it helped generate. If your service is free, the best alternative to capturing the value you create is to own the marketplace where that value is realized and exchanged.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTyg2E44pBA&amp;t=10m9s\">Musical.ly founder Alex Zhu likens starting a new social network to founding a new country and trying to attract citizens from established countries</a>. It's a fun analogy, though I prefer the cryptocurrency metaphor because most users are citizens of multiple social networks in the tech world, managing their social capital assets across all of those networks as a sort of diversified portfolio of status.</p><p>For the individual user, we've standardized on a few basic social capital accumulation mechanisms. There is the profile, to which your metrics attach, most notably your follower count and list. Followers or friends are the atomic unit of many social networks, and the advantage of followers as a measure is it generally tends to only grow over time. It also makes for an easy global ranking metric.</p><p>Local scoring of social capital at the atomic level usually exists in the form of likes of some sort, one of the universal primitives of just about every social network. These are more ephemeral in nature given the nature of feeds, which tend to prioritize distribution of more recent activity, but most social networks have some version of this since followers tend to accumulate more slowly. Likes correlate more strongly with your activity volume and serve as a source of continual short-term social capital injections, even if each like is, in the long-run, less valuable than a follower or a friend.</p><p>Some networks allow for accelerated distribution of posts through resharing, like retweeting (with many unintended consequences, but that's a discussion for another day). Some also allow comments, and there are other network-specific variants, but most of these are some form of social capital that can attach to posts.</p><p>Again, this isn't earth-shattering to most users of social networks. However, where it’s instructive is in examining those social networks which make such social capital accumulation difficult.</p><p>A good example is the anonymous social network, like Whisper or Secret. The premise of such social networks was that anonymity would enable users to share information and opinions they would otherwise be hesitant to be associated with. But, as is often the case, that strength turned out to be a weakness, because users couldn't really claim any of the social capital they'd created there. Many of the things written on these networks were so toxic that to claim ownership of them would be social capital negative in the aggregate.</p><p>A network like Reddit solved this through its implementation of karma, but it's fair to say that it's also been a long struggle for Reddit to suppress the dark asymmetric incentives unlocked by detaching social capital from real-life identity and reputation.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://twitter.com/balajis\" target=\"_blank\">Balaji Srinivasan</a> once mentioned that someday the cryptocurrencies might allow someone to extract the value from an anonymous social network without revealing their identity publicly, but for now, at least, a lot of this status on social networks isn’t monetary in nature. A lot of it’s just for the lulz.]</p><p>For any single user, the stickiness of a social network often correlates strongly with the volume of social capital they've amassed on that network. People sometimes will wholesale abandon social networks, but it's rare unless the status earned there has undergone severe deflation.</p><p>Social capital does tend to be non-fungible which also tends to make it easier to abandon ship. If your Twitter followers aren't worth anything on another network, it's less painful to just walk away from the account if it isn't worth the trouble anymore. It's strange to think that social networks like Twitter and Facebook once allowed users to just wholesale export their graphs to other networks since it allowed competing networks to jumpstart their social capital assets in a massive way, but that only goes to show how even some of the largest social networks at the time underestimated the massive value of their social capital assets. Facebook also, at one point, seemed to overestimate the value of inbound social capital that they'd capture by allowing third party services and apps to build on top of their graph.</p><p>The restrictions on porting graphs is a positive from the perspective of the incumbent social networks, but from a user point-of-view, it's frustrating. Given the difficulty of grappling with social networks given the consumer welfare standard for antitrust, an option for curbing the power of massive network effects businesses is to require that users be allowed to take their graph with them to other networks (as many have suggested). This would blunt the power of social networks along the social capital axis and force them to compete more on utility and entertainment axes.</p><h3>Social Capital Arbitrage</h3><p>Because social networks often attract different audiences, and because the configuration of graphs even when there are overlapping users often differ, opportunities exist to arbitrage social capital across apps.</p><p>A prominent user of this tactic was @thefatjewish, the popular Instagram account (his real name was Josh Ostrovsky). He accumulated millions of followers on Instagram in large part by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/8/19/9178145/fat-jew-plagiarism-instagram\">taking other people's jokes from Twitter and other social networks and then posting them as his own on Instagram</a>. Not only did he rack up followers and likes by the millions, he even got signed with CAA!</p><p>When he got called on it, he claimed it wasn't what he was about. He <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/exclusive-interview-the-fat-jew.html\">said</a>, \"Again, Instagram is just part of a larger thing I do. I have an army of interns working out of the back of a nail salon in Queens. We have so much stuff going on: I'm writing a book, I've got rosé. I need them to bathe me. I've got so many other things that I need them to do. It just didn't seem like something that was extremely dire.\" Which is really a long, bizarre way of saying, you caught me. Let he who does not have an army of interns bathing them throw the first stone.</p><p>Since then, similar joke aggregator accounts on Instagram have continued to proliferate, but some of them now follow the post-fatjewish-scandal social norm of including the proper attribution for each joke in the photo (for example including the Twitter username and profile pic within the photo of the “borrowed” tweet). But many do not, and even for those who do, the most prominent can trigger a backlash. The hashtag #fuckfuckjerry is an emergent <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/fuckfuckjerry-the-limits-of-extremely-online-organizing/582556/\" target=\"_blank\">protest</a> against the popular Instagram account @fuckjerry which, like @fatjewish, curates the best jokes from others and daytraded that into a small media company, one that featured in the Fyre Festival debacle.</p><p>As long as we have multiple social networks that don't quite work the same way, there will continue to be these social media arbitragers copying work from one network and to a different network to accumulate social capital on closing the distribution gap. Before the internet, men resorted to quoting movies or Mitch Hedberg jokes in conversation, to steal a bit of personality and wit from a more gifted comedian. This is the modern form of that, supercharged with internet-scale reach.</p><p>At some level, a huge swath of social media posts are just attempts to build status off of someone else's work. The two tenets at the start of this article predict that this type of arbitrage will always be with us. Consider someone linking to an article from Twitter or Facebook, or posting a screenshot of a paragraph from someone else's book. The valence of the reaction from the original creators seems to vary according to how the spoils of resharing are divvied up. The backlash to Instagram accounts like @thefatjewish and @fuckjerry may stem from the fact that they don't really share value from those whose jokes they redistribute, whereas posting an excerpt from a book on Twitter, for example, generates welcome publicity for the author.</p><h3>Social Capital Games as Temporary Energy Sources</h3><p>Structured properly, social capital incentive structures can serve as an invaluable incentive. For example, curation of good content across the internet remains an never-ending problem in this age of infinite content, so offering rewards for surfacing interesting things remains one of the oldest and most reliable marketplaces of the internet.</p><p>A canonical example is Reddit, where users bring interesting links, among other content, in exchange for a currency literally named karma. Accumulate enough karma and you'll unlock other benefits, like the ability to create your own subreddit, or to join certain private subreddits.</p><p>Twitter is another social network where people tend to bring interesting content in the hopes of amassing more followers and likes. If you follow enough of the right accounts, Twitter becomes an interestingness pellet dispenser.</p><p>Some companies which aren't typically thought of as social networks still turn to social capital games to solve a particular problem. On one Christmas vacation, I stumbled downstairs for a midnight snack and found my friend, a father of three, still up, typing on his laptop. What, I asked, was he doing still up when he had to get up in a few hours to take care of his kids? He was, he admitted sheepishly, banging out a litany of reviews to try to maintain his Yelp Elite status. To this day, some of my friends still speak wistfully about some of the Yelp Elite parties they attended back in the day. </p><p>Think of how many reviews Yelp accumulate in the early days just by throwing a few parties? It was, no doubt, well worth it, and at the point when it isn't (what's the marginal value of writing the, at last count, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ippudo-new-york-new-york?osq=ippudo\">9655th review of Ippudo in New York City</a>?), it's something easily dialed back or deprecated.</p><p>Amazon isn't typically thought of as a company that understands social, but in its earliest days, before even Yelp, it employed a similar tactic to boost its volume of user reviews. Amazon Top Reviewers was a globally ranked list of every reviewer on all of Amazon. You could boost your standing by accumulating more useful review votes from shoppers for your reviews. I'll always remember <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/29/the-woman-who-wrote-31014-amazon-book-reviews-and-upended-the-internet-dead-at-63-2/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.0b52d4805ea1\">Harriet Klausner</a>, who dominated that list for years, reviewing seemingly every book in print. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/leaderboard/top-reviewers\">Amazon still maintains a top customer reviewer list</a>, but it has been devalued over time as volume of reviews is no longer a real problem for Amazon.</p><p>Another example of a status game that Amazon employed to great effect, and which doesn't exist anymore, was Global Sales Rank. For a period, every product on Amazon got ranked against every other product in a dynamic sales rank leaderboard, and the figure would be displayed prominently near the top of each product detail page. Book authors pointed customers to Amazon to buy their books in the hope of goosing their sales rank the same way authors today often commit to buy some volume of their own book when it releases in the hopes of landing on the NYTimes bestseller list the week it releases.</p><p>IMDb and Wikipedia are two companies which built up entire valuable databases almost entirely by building mechanisms to harness the equal mix of status-seeking and altruism of domain experts. As with Reddit, accumulating a certain amount of reputation on these services unlocked additional abilities, and both companies built massive databases of information with very low production and editorial costs.</p><p>You can think of social capital accumulation incentives like these as ways to transform the potential energy  of status into whatever form of kinetic energy your venture needs.</p><h3>Why Most Celebrity Apps Fail</h3><p>For a while, a trend among celebrities was to launch their own app. The Kardashian app is perhaps the most prominent example, but there are others.</p><p>From a social capital perspective, these create little value because they simply draw down upon the celebrity's own status. Almost every person who joins just wants content from the eponymous celebrity. The volume of interaction between the users of the app themselves, the fans, is minimal to non-existent. Essentially these apps are self-owned distribution channels for the stars, and as such, they tend to be vanity projects rather than durable assets.</p><p>One can imagine such apps trying to foster more interaction among the users, but that is a really complex effort, and most such efforts have neither the skills to take this on nor the will or capital necessary to see it through.</p><p>Another way to think of all these celebrity ventures is to measure the social capital and utility of the product or service if you remove all the social capital from the celebrity in question. A lot minus a lot equals zero.</p><h3>Conclusion: Everybody Wants to Rule the World</h3><p>In the immortal words of Obi-Wan Kenobi, \"Status is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.\" </p><p>That many of the largest tech companies are, in part, status as a service businesses, is not often discussed. Most people don't like to admit to being motivated by status, and few CEO's are going to admit that the job to be done for their company is stroking people’s egos.</p><p>From a user perspective, people are starting to talk more and more about the soul-withering effects of playing an always-on status game through the social apps on their always connected phones. You could easily replace Status as a Service with FOMO as a Service. It’s one reason you can still meet so many outrageously wealthy people in Manhattan or Silicon Valley who are still miserable.</p><p>This piece is not my contribution to the well-trod genre of Medium thinkpieces counseling stoicism and Buddhism or transcendental meditation or deleting apps off of your phone to find inner peace. There is wisdom in all of those, but if I have anything to offer on that front, it’s this: if you want control of your own happiness, don’t tie it to someone else’s scoreboard.</p><p>Recall the wisdom of Neil McCauley in the great film <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Et2ORU\" target=\"_blank\">Heat</a>.</p>\n",

      "<p>At the end of Heat, he fails to follow his own advice, and look what happened to him.</p><p>Yet, I come not to bury Caesar, but also not to praise him. Rather, as Emily Wilson says at the start of her brilliant new translation of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VpNLOt\" target=\"_blank\">The Odyssey</a>, “tell me about a complicated man.” So much of the entire internet was built on a foundation of social capital, of intangible incentives like reputation. Before the tech giants of today, I combed through newsgroups, blogs, massive FAQs, and countless other resources built by people who felt, in part, a jolt of dopamine from the recognition that comes from contributing to the world at large. At Amazon, someone coined a term for this type of motivational currency: egoboo (short for, you guessed it, egoboost). Something like Wikipedia, built in large part on egoboo, is a damned miracle. I don’t want to lose that. I don’t think we have to lose that.</p><p>Of course, like the Force, status is equally potent as fuel for the darkest, cruelest parts of human nature. If you look at the respective mission statements of Twitter and Facebook—\"to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers\" and “to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected”—what is striking is the assumption that these are fundamentally positive outcomes. There’s no questioning of what the downsides of connecting everyone and enabling instant sharing of information among anyone might be.</p><p>Of course, both companies, and many others, have now had to grapple with the often unbounded downside risk of just wiring together billions of people with few guardrails. Reading the Senate Intelligence Committee reports on Russian infiltration of social networks in the 2016 election, what emerges is unsettling: in so many ways the Russians had a more accurate understanding of the users of these services than the product teams running them. In either case, much of the cost has been born not by the companies themselves but society. Companies benefit from the limitless upside of their models, so it’s not unreasonable to expect them to bear the costs, just as we expect corporations to bear the cost of polluting rivers with their factories. If we did, as Hunter Walk has <a href=\"https://hunterwalk.com/2018/03/02/is-the-quest-for-software-margins-to-blame-for-twitters-trolls-facebooks-russians-and-youtubes-fake-news/\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a>, profit margins would be lower, but society and discourse might be healthier.</p><p>Contrary to some popular Twitter counsel, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1098464678437507072\" target=\"_blank\">the problem is not that the leaders of these companies don’t have humanities degrees</a>. But the solution also doesn’t lie in ignoring that humans are wired to pursue social capital. In fact, overlooking this fundamental aspect of human nature arguably landed us here, at the end of this first age of social network goliaths, wondering where it all went haywire. If we think of these networks as marketplaces trading only in information, and not in status, then we're only seeing part of the machine. The menacing phone call has been coming from inside the house all along. Ben Thompson refers to this naivete from tech executives as <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/the-pollyannish-assumption/\" target=\"_blank\">the pollyannish assumption</a>.</p><p>Having worked on multiple products in my career, I’m sympathetic to the fact that no product survives engagement with humans intact, But this first era of Status as a Service businesses is closing, and pleading ignorance won’t work moving forward. To do so is to come off like Captain Louis Renault in Casablanca. </p>\n",

We maintained several time horizons for our forward forecasts, from granular monthly forecasts to quarterly and annual forecasts to even five and ten year forecasts for the purposes of fund-raising and, well, strategic planning.</p><p>One of the most difficult things to forecast was our adoption rate. We were a public company, though, and while Jeff would say, publicly, that \"in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, in the long run, it's a scale,\" that doesn't provide any air cover for strategic planning. It's your job to know what's going to happen in the future as best as possible, and every CFO of a public company will tell you that they take the forward guidance portion of their job seriously. Because of information asymmetry, analysts who cover your company depend quite a bit on guidance on quarterly earnings calls to shape their forecasts and coverage for their clients. It's not just that giving the wrong guidance might lead to a correction in your stock price but that it might indicate that you really have no idea where your business is headed, a far more damaging long-run reveal.</p><p>It didn't take long for me to see that our visibility out a few months, quarters, and even a year was really accurate (and precise!). What was more of a puzzle, though, was the long-term outlook. Every successful business goes through the famous S-curve, and most companies, and their investors, spend a lot of time looking for that inflection point towards hockey-stick growth. But just as important, and perhaps less well studied, is that unhappy point later in the S-curve, when you hit a shoulder and experience a flattening of growth.</p><p>One of the huge advantages for us at Amazon was that we always had a fairly good proxy for our total addressable market (TAM). It was easy to pull the statistics for the size of the global book market. Just as a rule of thumb, one could say that if we took 10% of the global book market it would mean our annual revenues would be X. One could be really optimistic and say that we might even expand the TAM, but finance tends to be the conservative group in the company by nature (only the paranoid survive and all that).</p><p>When I joined Amazon I was thrown almost immediately into working with a bunch of MBA's on business plans for music, video, packaged software, magazines, and international. I came to think of our long-term TAM as a straightforward layer cake of different retail markets.</p><p>Still, the gradient of adoption was somewhat of a mystery. I could, in my model, understand that one side of it was just exposure. That is, we could not obtain customers until they'd heard of us, and I could segment all of those paths of exposure into fairly reliable buckets: referrals from affiliate sites (we called them Associates), referrals from portals (AOL, Excite, Yahoo, etc.), and word-of-mouth (this was pre-social networking but post-email so the velocity of word-of-mouth was slower than it is today). Awareness is also readily trackable through any number of well-tested market research methodologies.</p><p>Still, for every customer who heard of Amazon, how could I forecast whether they'd make a purchase or not? Why would some people use the service while others decided to pass?</p><p>For so many startups and even larger tech incumbents, the point at which they hit the shoulder in the S-curve is a mystery, and I suspect the failure to see it occurs much earlier. The good thing is that identifying the enemy sooner allows you to address it. We focus so much on product-market fit, but once companies have achieved some semblance of it, most should spend much more time on the problem of product-market unfit.</p><p>For me, in strategic planning, the question in building my forecast was to flush out what I call the <strong>invisible asymptote</strong>: a ceiling that our growth curve would bump its head against if we continued down our current path. It's an important concept to understand for many people in a company, whether a CEO, a product person, or, as I was back then, a planner in finance.</p><h3>Amazon's invisible asymptote</h3><p>Fortunately for Amazon, and perhaps critical to much of its growth over the years, perhaps the single most important asymptote was one we identified very early on. Where our growth would flatten if we did not change our path was, in large part, due to this single factor.</p><p>We had two ways we were able to flush out this enemy. For people who did shop with us, we had, for some time, a pop-up survey that would appear right after you'd placed your order, at the end of the shopping cart process. It was a single question, asking why you didn't purchase more often from Amazon. For people who'd never shopped with Amazon, we had a third party firm conduct a market research survey where we'd ask those people why they did not shop from Amazon.</p><p>Both converged, without any ambiguity, on one factor. You don't even need to rewind to that time to remember what that factor is because I suspect it's the same asymptote governing e-commerce and many other related businesses today.</p><p><strong>Shipping fees</strong>.</p><p>People hate paying for shipping. They despise it. It may sound banal, even self-evident, but understanding that was, I'm convinced, so critical to much of how we unlocked growth at Amazon over the years.</p><p>People don't just hate paying for shipping, they hate it to literally an irrational degree. We know this because our first attempt to address this was to show, in the shopping cart and checkout process, that even after paying shipping, customers were saving money over driving to their local bookstore to buy a book because, at the time, most Amazon customers did not have to pay sales tax. That wasn't even factoring in the cost of getting to the store, the depreciation costs on the car, and the value of their time.</p><p>People didn't care about this rational math. People, in general, are terrible at valuing their time, perhaps because for most people monetary compensation for one's time is so detached from the event of spending one's time. Most time we spend isn't like deliberate practice, with immediate feedback.</p><p>Wealthy people tend to receive a much more direct and immediate payoff for their time which is why they tend to be better about valuing it. This is why the first thing that most ultra-wealthy people I know do upon becoming ultra-wealthy is to hire a driver and start to fly private. For most normal people, the opportunity cost of their time is far more difficult to ascertain moment to moment.</p><p>You can't imagine what a relief it is to have a single overarching obstacle to focus on as a product person. It's the same for anyone trying to solve a problem. Half the comfort of diets that promise huge weight loss in exchange for cutting out sugar or carbs or whatever is feeling like there's a really simple solution or answer to a hitherto intractable, multi-dimensional problem.</p><p>Solving people's distaste for paying shipping fees became a multi-year effort at Amazon. Our next crack at this was Super Saver Shipping: if you placed an order of $25 or more of qualified items, which included mostly products in stock at Amazon, you'd receive free standard shipping.</p><p>The problem with this program, of course, was that it caused customers to reduce their order frequency, waiting until their orders qualified for the free shipping. In select cases, forcing customers to minimize consumption of your product-service is the right long-term strategy, but this wasn't one of those.</p><p>That brings us to Amazon Prime. This is a good time to point out that shipping physical goods isn't free. Again, self-evident, but it meant that modeling Amazon Prime could lead to widely diverging financial outcomes depending on what you thought it would do to the demand curve and average order composition.</p><p>To his credit, Jeff decided to forego testing and just go for it. It's not so uncommon in technology to focus on growth to the exclusion of all other things and then solve for monetization in the long run, but it's easier to do so for a social network than a retail business with real unit economics. The more you sell, the more you lose is not and has never been a sustainable business model (<a href=\"http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2013/10/25/amazon-and-the-profitless-business-model-narrative\" target=\"_blank\">people confuse this for Amazon's business model all the time</a>, and still do, which ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).</p><p>The rest, of course, is history. Or at least near-term history. It turns out that you can have people pre-pay for shipping through a program like Prime and they're incredibly happy to make the trade. And yes, on some orders, and for some customers, the financial trade may be a lossy one for the business, but on net, the dramatic shift in the demand curve is stunning and game-changing.</p><p>And, as Jeff always noted, you can make micro-adjustments in the long run to tweak the profit leaks. For some really large, heavy items, you can tack on shipping surcharges or just remove them from qualifying for Prime. These days, some items in Amazon are marked as \"Add-on items\" and you can only order them in conjunction with enough other items such that they can be shipped with those items rather than in isolation.</p><p>[Jeff counseled the same \"fix it later\" strategy in the early days when we didn't have good returns tracking. For a window of time in the early days of Amazon, if you shipped us a box of books for returns, we couldn't easily tell if you'd purchase them at Amazon and so we'd credit you for them, no questions asked. One woman took advantage of this loophole and shipped us boxes and boxes of books. Given our limited software resources, Jeff said to just ignore the lady and build a way to solve for that later. It was really painful, though, so eventually customer service representatives all shared, amongst themselves, the woman's name so they could look out for it in return requests even before such systems were built. Like a mugshot pinned to every monitor saying \"Beware this customer.\" A tip of the hat to you, maam, wherever you are, for your enterprising spirit in exploiting that loophole!]</p><p>Prime is a type of scale moat for Amazon because it isn't easy for other retailers to match from a sheer economic and logistical standpoint. As noted before, shipping isn't actually free when you have to deliver physical goods. The really challenging unit economics of delivery businesses like Postmates, when paired with people's aversion for paying for shipping, makes for tough sledding, at least until the cost of delivering such goods can be lowered drastically, perhaps by self-driving cars or drones or some such technology shift.</p><p>Furthermore, very few customers shop enough with retailers other than Amazon to make a pre-pay program like Prime worthwhile to them. Even if they did, it's very likely Amazon's economies of scale in shipping and deep knowledge of how to distribute their inventory optimally means their unit economics on delivery are likely superior.</p><p>The net of it is that long before Amazon hit what would've been an invisible asymptote on its e-commerce growth it had already erased it.</p><p>Know thine enemy.</p><h3><strong>Invisible asymptotes are...invisible</strong></h3><p>An obvious problem for many companies, however, is that they are creating new types of businesses and services that don't lend themselves to easily identifying such invisible asymptotes. Many are not like Amazon where there are readily tracked metrics like the size of the global book market with which to peg their TAM.</p><p>Take social networks, for example. What's the shoulder of the curve for something like Facebook? Twitter? Instagram? Snapchat?</p><p>Some of the limits to their growth are easier to spot than others. For messaging and some more general social networking apps, for example, in many cases network effects are geographical. Since these apps build on top of real-world social graphs, and many of those are geographically clustered, there are winner-take-all dynamics such that in many countries one messaging app dominates, like Kakao in Korea or Line in Taiwan. There can be geo-political considerations, too, that help ensure that that WeChat will dominate in China to the exclusion of all competitors, for example.</p><p>For others, though, it takes a bit more product insight, and some might say intuition, to see the ceiling before you bump into it. For both employees and investors, understanding product-market unfit follows very closely on identifying product-market fit as an existential challenge.</p><p>Without direct access to internal metrics and research, it's difficult to use much other than public information and my own product intuition to analyze potential asymptotes for many companies, but let's take a quick survey of several more prominent companies and consider some of their critical asymptotes (these companies are large enough that they likely have many, but I'll focus on the macro). You can apply this to startups, too, but there are some differences between achieving initial product market fit and avoiding the shoulder in the S-curve after already having found it.</p><p><strong>Twitter</strong></p><p>Let's start with Twitter, for many in tech the most frustrating product from the perspective of the gap between the actual and the potential. Its user growth has been flat for quite some time, and so it can be said to have already run full speed into an invisible asymptote. In quarterly earnings calls, it's apparent management often have no idea if or when or how that might shift because their guidance is often a collective shrug.</p><p>One popular early school of thought on Twitter, a common pattern with most social networks, is that more users need to experience what the power users or early adopters are experiencing and they'll turn into active users. Many a story of social networks who've continued to grow point to certain keystone metrics as pivotal to unlocking product-market fit. For example, once you've friended 30 people on Facebook, you're hooked. For Twitter, an equivalent may be following enough people to generate an interesting feed.</p><p>Pattern-matching moves more quickly through Silicon Valley than almost any other place I've lived, so stories like that are passed around through employees and Board meetings and other places where the rich and famous tech elite hobnob, and so it's not surprising that this theory is raised for every social network that hits the shoulder in their S-curve.</p><p>There's more than a whiff of Geoffrey Moore's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IDhph6\" target=\"_blank\">Crossing the Chasm</a>&nbsp;in this idea, some sense that moving from early adopters to the mainstream involves convincing more users to use the same product/service as early adopters do.</p><p>In the case of Twitter, I think the theory is wrong. Given the current configuration of the product, I don't think any more meaningful user growth is possible, and tweaking the product as it is now won't unlock any more growth. The longer they don't acknowledge this, the longer they'll be stuck in a <a href=\"https://www.fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Queen</a> loop of their own making.</p><p>Sometimes, the product-market fit with early adopters is only that. The product won't go mainstream because other people don't want or need that product. In these cases, the key to unlocking growth is usually customer segmentation, creating different products for different users.</p><p>Mistaking one type of business for the other can be a deadly mistake because the strategies for addressing them are so different. A common symptom of this mistake is not seeing the shoulder in the S-curve coming at all, not understanding the nature of your product-market unfit.</p><p>I believe the core experience of Twitter has reached most everyone in the world who likes it. Let's examine the core attributes of Twitter the product (which I treat as distinct from Twitter the service, the public messaging protocol).</p><p>It is heavily text-based, with 140 and now 280 character limit snippets of text from people you've followed presented in a vertical scrolling feed in some algorithmic order, which, for the purposes of this exercise, I'll just consider roughly chronological.</p><p>For fans, most of whom are infovores, the nature of product-market fit is, as with many of our tech products today, one of addiction. Because the chunks of text are short, if one tweet is of no interest, you can quickly scan and scroll to another with little effort. Discovering tweets of interest in what appears to be a largely random order rewards the user with dopamine hits on that time-tested Skinner box variable frequency. Instead of rats hitting levers for pellets of food, power Twitter user push or pull on their phone screens for the next tasty pellet of text.</p><p>For infovores, text, in contrast to photos or videos or music, is the medium of choice from a velocity standpoint. There is deep satisfaction in quickly decoding the textual information, the scan rate is self-governed on the part of the reader, unlike other mediums which unfold at their own pace (this is especially the case with video, which infovores hate for its low scannability).</p><p>Over time, this loop tightens and accelerates through the interaction of all the users on Twitter. Likes and retweets and other forms of feedback guide people composing tweets to create more of the type that receive positive feedback. The ideal tweet (which I mean one that will receive maximum positive feedback) combines some number of the following attributes:</p><ul><li><p>Is pithy. Sounds like a fortune cookie. The character limit encourages this type of compression.</p></li><li><p>Is slightly surprising. This can be a contrarian idea or just a cliche encoded in a semi-novel way.</p></li><li><p>Rewards some set of readers' priors, injecting a pleasing dose of confirmation bias directly into the bloodstream.</p></li><li><p>Blasts someone that some set of people dislike intensely. This is closely related to the previous point.</p></li><li><p>Is composed by someone famous, preferably someone a lot of people like but don't consider to be a full-time Tweeter, like Chrissy Teigen or Kanye West.</p></li><li><p>Is on a topic that most people think they understand or on which they have an opinion.</p></li></ul><p>Of course, the set of ideal qualities varies by subgroup on Twitter. Black Twitter differs from rationalist Twitter which differs from NBA Twitter. The meta point is that the flywheel spins more and more quickly over time within each group.</p><p>The problem is that for those who don't use Twitter, almost all of its ideal attributes among the early adopter cohort are those which other people find bewildering and unattractive. Many people find the text-heavy nature of Twitter to be a turn-off. The majority of people, actually.</p><p>The naturally random sort order of ideas that comes from the structure of Twitter, one which pings the pleasure centers of the current heavy user cohort when they find an interesting tweet, is utterly perplexing to those who don't get the service. Why should they hunt and peck for something of interest? Why are conversations so difficult to follow (actually, this is a challenge even for those who enjoy Twitter)? Why do people have to work so hard to parse the context of tweets?</p><p>Falling into the trap of thinking other users will be like you is especially pernicious because the people building the product are usually among that early adopter cohort. The easiest north star for a product person is their own intuition. But if they're working on a product that requires customer segmentation, being in the early adopter cohort means one's instincts will keep guiding you towards the wrong North star and the company will just keep bumping into the invisible asymptote without any idea why.</p><p>This points to an important qualifier to the \"crossing the chasm\" idea of technology diffusion. If the chasm is large enough, the same product can't cross it. Instead, on the other side of the gaping chasm is just a different country altogether, with different constituents with different needs.</p><p>I use Twitter a lot (I recently received a notification I'd passed my 11-year anniversary of joining the service) but almost everyone in my family, from my parents to my siblings to my girlfriend to my nieces and nephews has tried and given up on Twitter. It doesn't fulfill any deep-seated need for any of them.</p><p>It's not surprising to me that Twitter is populated heavily by journalists and a certain cohort of techies and intellectuals who all, to me, are part of a broader species of infovore. For them, opening Twitter must feel as if they've donned Cerebro and have global contact with thousands of brains all over the world, as if the fabric of their brain had been flattened and stretched out wide and laid on top of that of millions of others brains all over the world.</p>\n",

      "<p>Mastering Twitter is already something this group of people do all the time in their lives and jobs, only Twitter accelerates it, like a bicycle for intellectual conversation and preening. Twitter, at its best, can provide a feeling of near real-time communal knowledge sharing that satisfies some of the same needs as something like SoulCycle or Peloton. A feeling of communion that also feels like it's productive.</p><p>If my instincts are right, then all the iterating around the margins on Twitter won't do much of anything to change the growth curve of the service. It might improve the experience for the current cohort of users and increase usage (for example, curbing abuse and trolls is an immediate and obvious win for those who experience all sorts of terrible harassment on the service), but it doesn't change the fact that this core Twitter product isn't for all the people who left the club long ago, soon after they walked in and realized it was just a bunch of nerds who'd ordered La Croix bottle service and were sitting around talking about Bitcoin and stoicism and transcendental meditation.</p><p>The good news is that the Twitter service, that public messaging protocol with a one-way follow model, could be the basis for lots of products that might appeal to other people in the world. Knowing the enemy can prevent wasting time chasing the wrong strategy.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the main paths towards coming up with new products built on top of that protocol was the third party developer program, and, well, Twitter has treated its third party developers like unwanted stepchildren for a long time. For whatever reason, it's difficult to speculate without having been there, Twitter's rate of product development internally has been glacial. A vibrant third party-developer program could have helped by massively increasing the vectors of development on Twitter's very elegant public messaging protocol and datasets.</p><p>[Note, however, that I'm sympathetic to tech companies that restrict building clones of their service using their API's. No company owes it to others to allow people to build direct competitors to their own product. Most people don't remember, but Amazon's first web services offering was for affiliates to build sites to sell things. Some sites started building massive Amazon clones and so Amazon's web services evolved into other forms, eventually settling on what most people know it as today.]</p><p>In addition, I've long wondered if the shutting out of third party developers on Twitter was an attempt to aggregate and own all their own ad inventory. Both these problems could've been solved by tweaking the Twitter third party development program. Developers could be offered two paths.</p><p>One option is that for every X number of tweets a developer pulled, they'd have to carry and display a Twitter-inserted ad unit. This would make it possible for Twitter to support third-party clients like Tweetbot that compete somewhat with Twitter's own clients. Maybe one of these developers would come up with improvements on top of Twitter's own client apps, but in doing so they'd increase Twitter's ad inventory.</p><p>The second option would be to pay some fixed fee for every X tweets pulled. That would force the developer to come up with some monetization scheme on their own to cover their usage, but at least the option would exist. I don't doubt that some enterprising developers might come up with some way to monetize a particular use case, for example for business research.</p><p>Twitter the product/app has hit its invisible asymptote. Twitter the protocol still has untapped potential.</p><p><strong>Snapchat</strong></p><p>Snapchat is another example of a company that's hit a shoulder in its growth curve. Unlike Twitter, though, I suspect its invisible asymptote is less an issue of its feature set and more one of a generational divide.</p><p>That's not to say that making the interface less inscrutable earlier on wouldn't have helped a bit, but I suspect only at the margins. In fact, the opaque nature of the interface probably served Snapchat incredibly well when the product came along, regardless of whether or not it was intended that way. Snapchat came along at a moment when kids' parents were joining Facebook, and when Facebook had been around long enough for the paper trail of its early, younger users to come back and bite some of them.</p><p>Along comes a service that not only wipes out content by default after a short period of time but is inscrutable to the very parents who might crash the party. In fact, there's an entire class of products for which I believe an Easter Egg-like interface is actually preferable to an elegant, self-describing interface, long seen as the apex of UI design (more on that another day).</p><p>I've written before about <a href=\"http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/9/14/selfies-as-a-second-language\" target=\"_blank\">selfies as a second language</a>. At the root of that phenomenon is the idea that a generation of kids raised with smartphones with a camera front and back have found the most efficient way to communicate is with the camera, not the keyboard. That's not the case for an older cohort of users who almost never send selfies as a first resort. The very default of Snapchat to the camera screen is such a bold choice that it will probably never be the messaging app of choice for old folks, no matter how Snapchat moves around and re-arranges its other panes.</p><p>More than that, I suspect every generation needs spaces of its own, places to try on and leave behind identities at low cost and on short, finite time horizons. That applies to social virtual spaces as much as it does to physical spaces.</p><p>Look at how old people use Snapchat and you'll see lots of use of Stories. Watch a young person use Snapchat and it's predominantly one-to-one messaging using the camera (yes, I know some of the messages I receive on Snap are the same ones that person is sending to everyone one-to-one, but the hidden nature of that behavior allows me to indulge an egocentric rather than Copernican model of the universe). Now, it's possible for one app to serve multiple audiences that way, but it will either have to compromise all or some of its user experience to do so.</p><p>At a deeper level, I think a person's need for ephemeral content varies across one's lifetime. It's of much higher value when one is young, especially in formative years. As one ages, and time's counter starts to run low, one turns nostalgic, and the value of permanent content, especially from long bygone days, increases, serving as beautifully aged relics of another era. One also tends to be more adept at managing one's public image the more time passes, lessening the need for ephemerality.</p><p>All this is to say that I don't think making the interface of Snapchat easier to use is going to move it off of the shoulder on its S-curve. That's addressing a different underlying cause than the one that lies behind its invisible asymptote.</p><p>The good news for Snapchat is that I don't think Facebook is going to be able to attract the youngsters. I don't care if Facebook copies Snapchat's exact app one for one, it's not going to happen. The bad news for Snapchat is that it probably isn't going to attract the oldies either. The most interesting question is whether Snapchat's cohort stays with it for life, and the next interesting question is who attracts the next generation of kids to get their first smartphones. Will they, like every generation of youth before them, demand a social network of their own? Sometimes I think they will just to claim a namespace that isn't already spoken for. Who wants to be joesmith43213 when you can be joesmith on some new sexy social network?</p><p>As a competitor, however, Instagram is more worrisome than Facebook. It came along after Facebook, as Snapchat did, and so it had the opportunity to be a social network that a younger generation could roam as pioneers, mining so much social capital yet to be claimed. It is also largely an audio-visual network which is appealing to a more visually literate generation.</p><p>When Messenger incorporated Stories into its app, it felt like a middle-aged couple dressing in cowboy chic and attending Coachella. When Instagram cribbed Stories, though, it addressed a real supply-side content creation issue for the same young'uns who used Snapchat. That is, people were being too precious about what they shared on Instagram, decreasing usage frequency. By adding Stories, they created a mechanism that wouldn't force content into the feed and whose ephemerality encouraged more liberal capture and sharing without the associated guilt.</p><p>This is a general pattern among social networks and products in general: to broaden their appeal they tend to broaden their use cases. It's rare to see a product adhere strictly to its early specificity and still avoid hitting a shoulder in their adoption S-curve. Look at Facebook today compared to Facebook in its early days. Look at Amazon's product selection now compared to when it first launched.</p><p>It takes internal fortitude for a product team to make such concessions (I would say courage but we need to sprinkle that term around <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2016/9/7/16038622/why-did-apple-remove-the-headphone-jack-courage-592a412412b5\" target=\"_blank\">less liberally in tech</a>). The stronger the initial product market fit, the more vociferously your early adopters will protest when you make any changes. Like a band that is accused of selling out, there is an inevitable sense that a certain sharpness of flavor, of choice, has seeped out as more and more people join up and as a service loosens up and accommodates more more use cases.</p><p>I remember seeing so many normally level-headed people on Twitter threaten to abandon the service when they announced they were increasing the character limit from 140 to 280. The irony, of course, was that the character-limit increase likely improved the service for its current users while doing nothing to attract people who didn't use the service, even though the move was addressed mostly to heathen.</p><p>Back to Snapchat. I wrote a long time ago that <a href=\"http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2015/9/1/when-the-network-is-mature\" target=\"_blank\">the power of social networks lies in their graph</a>. That means many things, and in Snapchat's case it holds a particularly fiendish double bind. That Snapchat is the social network claimed by the young is both a blessing and a curse. Were a bunch of old folks to suddenly flock to Snapchat, it might induce a case of Groucho Marx's, \"I don't care to belong to a club that accepts people like me as members.\"</p><p><strong>Facebook</strong></p><p>On the dimension of utility, Facebook's network effects continue to be pure and unbounded. The more people that are on Facebook, the more it's useful for certain things for which a global directory is useful. Even though many folks don't use Facebook a lot, it's rare I can't find them on Messenger if I don't have their email address or phone number. The complexity of analyzing Facebook is that it serves different needs in different countries and markets, social network having strong path dependency in their usage patterns. In many countries, Facebook is the internet; it's odd as an American to travel to countries where businesses' only presence online is a Facebook page, so accustomed I am to searching for American businesses on the web or Yelp first.</p><p>When it comes to the \"social\" aspect of social networking, the picture is less clear-cut. Here I'll focus on the U.S. market since it's the one I'm most familiar with. Because Facebook is the largest social network in history, it may be encountering scaling challenges few other entities have ever seen.</p><p>The power of a social network lies in its graph, and that is a conundrum in many ways. One is that a massive graph is a blessing until it's a curse. For social creatures like humans who've long lived&nbsp; in smaller networks and tribes, a graph that conflates everyone you know is intimidating to broadcast to, except for those who have no compulsion about performing no matter the audience size:&nbsp;famous people, marketers, and those monstrous people who share everything about their lives. You know who you are.</p><p>This is one of the diseconomies of scale for social networks that Facebook is first to run into because of its unprecedented size. Imagine you're in a room with all your family, friends, coworkers, casual acquaintances, and a lot of people you met just once but felt guilty about rejecting a friend request from. It's hundreds, maybe even thousands of people. What would you say to them? We know people maintain multiple identities for different audiences in their lives. Very few of us have to cultivate an identity for that entire blob of everyone we know. It's a situation one might encounter in the real world only a few times in life, perhaps at one's wedding, and later one's funeral. Online, though? It happens to be the default mode on Facebook's News Feed.</p><p>It's no coincidence that public figures, those who have the most practice at having to deal with this problem, are so guarded. As your audience grows larger, the chance that you'll offend someone deeply with something you say approaches 1.</p><p>When I scan my Facebook feed, I see fewer and fewer people I know sharing anything at all. Map one's sharing frequency with the size of one's friend list on Facebook and I highly suspect it looks like this:</p>\n",

      "<p>Again, not everyone is like this, some psychopaths who are comfortable sharing their thoughts no matter the size of the audience, but these people are often annoying, the type who dive right into politics at Thanksgiving before you've even spooned gravy over your turkey. This leads to a form of adverse selection where a few over-sharers take over your News Feed.</p><p>[Not everything one shares gets distributed to one's entire friend graph given the algorithmic feed. But you as the one sharing something have no idea who will see it so you have to assume that any and every person in your graph will see it. The chilling effect is the same.]</p><p>Another form of diseconomy of scale is behind the flight to Snapchat among the young, as outlined earlier. A sure way to empty a club or a dance floor is to have the parents show up; few things are more traumatic then seeing your Dad pretend-grind on your Mom when \"Yeah\" by Usher comes on. Having your parents in your graph on Facebook means you have to assume they're listening, and there isn't some way to turn on the radio very loudly or run the water as in a spy movie when you're trying to pass secrets to someone in a room that's bugged. The best you can do is communicate in code to which your parents don't own the decryption key; usually this takes the form of memes. Or you take the communication over to Snapchat.</p><p>Another diseconomy of scale is the increasing returns to trolling. Facebook is more immune to this thanks to its bi-directional friending model than, say, Twitter, with its one-way follow model and public messaging framework. On Facebook, those wishing to sow dissension need to be a bit more devious, and as revelations from the last election showed, there are means to a person's heart, to reach them directly or indirectly, through confirmation bias and flattery. The Iago playbook from Othello. On Twitter, there's no need for such scheming, you can just nuke people from your keyboard without their consent.</p><p>All of this is to say I suspect many of Facebook's more fruitful vectors for rekindling their value for socializing lie in breaking up the surface area of their service. News Feed is so monolithic a surface as to be subject to all the diseconomies of scale of social networking, even as it makes it such an attractive advertising landscape.</p><p>The most obvious path to this is Groups, which can subdivide large graphs into ones more unified in purpose or ideology. Google+ was onto something with Circles, but since they hadn't actually achieved any scale they were solving a problem they didn't have yet.</p><p><strong>Instagram</strong></p><p>Where is Instagram's invisible asymptote? This is one of the trickier ones to contemplate as it continues to grow without any obvious end in sight.</p><p>One of the advantages to Instagram is that it came about when Facebook was broadening its acceptable media types from text to photos and video. Instagram began with just square photos with a simple caption, no links allowed, no resharing.</p><p>This had a couple of advantages. One is that it's harder to troll or be insufferable in photos than it is in text. Photos tend to soften the edge of boasts and provocations. More people are more skilled at being hurtful in text than photos. Instagram has tended to be more aggressive than other networks at policing the emotional tenor of its network, especially in contrast to, say Twitter, turning its attention most recently to addressing trolls in the comment sections.</p><p>Of course photos are not immune to this phenomenon. The \"look at my perfect life\" boasting of Instagram is many people's chief complaint about the app and likely the primary driver of people feeling lousy after looking through their feed there. Still, outright antagonism with Instagram, given it isn't an open public graph like Twitter, is harder. The one direct vector is comments and Instagram is working on that issue.</p><p>In being a pure audio-visual network at a time when Facebook and most other networks were mixed-media, Instagram siphoned off many people for whom the best part of Facebook was just the photos and videos; again, we often, as with Twitter, over-estimate the product-market fit and TAM of text. If Facebook just showed photos and videos for a week I suspect their usage would grow, but since they own Instagram...</p><p>As with other social networks that grow, Instagram broadened its formats early on to head off several format-based asymptotes. Non-square photos and videos with gradually lengthening time limits have broadened the use cases and, more importantly, removed some level of production friction.</p><p>The move to copy Snapchat's Stories format was the next giant asymptote avoided. The precious nature of sharing on Instagram was a drag on posting frequency. Stories solves the supply-side issue for content several ways. One is that since it requires you to explicitly tap into viewing it from the home feed screen, it shifts the onus for viewing the content entirely to the audience. This frees the content creator from much of the guilt of polluting someone else's feed. The expiring nature of the content further removes another of a publisher's inhibitions about littering the digital landscape. It unlocked so much content that I now regularly fail to make it through more than a tiny fraction of Stories on Instagram. Even friends who don't publish a lot now often put their content in Stories rather than posting to the main feed.</p><p>The very format of Stories, with its full-screen vertical orientation, cues the user that this format is meant for the native way we hold our devices as smartphone photographers, rather than accommodating the more natural landscape way that audiences view the world, with eyes side-by-side in one's head. Stories includes accoutrements like gaudy stickers and text overlays and face filters that aren't in the toolset for Instagram's main feed photo/video composer, perhaps to preserve some aesthetic separation between the main feed and Stories.</p><p>There is a purity about Instagram which makes even its ads perfectly native: everything on the service is an audio-visual advertisement. I see people complain about the ad load in Instagram, but if you really look at your feed, it's always had an ad load of 100%.</p><p>I just opened my feed and looked through the first twenty posts, and I'd classify them all as ads: about how great my meal was, for beautiful travel destinations, for the exquisite craft of various photographers and cinematographers, for an actor's upcoming film, for Rihanna's new lingerie line or makeup drop, for an elaborate dish a friend cooked, for a current concert tour, for how funny someone is, for someone's gorgeous new headshot, and for a few sporting events and teams. And yes, a few of them were official Instagram ads.</p><p>I don't mean this in a negative way. One might lobby this accusation at all social networks, but the visual nature of Instagram absorbs the signaling function of social media in the most elegant and unified way. For example, messaging apps consist of a lot of communication that isn't advertising. But that's exactly why a messaging app like Messenger isn't as lucrative an ad platform as Instagram is and will be. If ads weren't marked explicitly, and if they weren't so obviously from accounts I don't follow, it's not clear to me that they'd be so jarringly different in nature than all the other content in the feed.</p><p>The irony is that, as Facebook broadened its use cases and supported media types to continue to expand, the purity of Instagram may have made it more scalable a network in some ways.</p><p>Of course, every product or service has some natural ceiling. To take one example, messaging with other folks is still somewhat clunky on Instagram, it feels tacked on. Considering how much young people use Snapchat as a messaging app of choice, there's likely attractive headroom for Instagram here.</p><p>Rumors Instagram is contemplating a separate messaging app make sense. It would be ironic if Instagram separated out the more broadcast nature of its core app from the messaging use case in two different apps before Snapchat did. As noted earlier, it feels as if Snapchat is constantly fighting to balance the messaging parts of its app with the more broadcast elements like Stories and Discover, and separate apps might be one way to solve that more effectively.</p><p>As with all social networks which are mobile-phone dominant, there are limits to what can be optimized for in a single app, when all you have to work with is a single rectangular phone screen. The mobile phone revolution forced a focus in design which created billions of dollars in value, but Instagram, like all phone apps, will run into the asymptote that is the limits of how much you can jam into one app.</p><p>Instagram has already had some experience in dealing with this conundrum, creating separate apps like Boomerang or Hyperlapse that keep a lid on the complexity of the Instagram app itself and which bring additional composition techniques to the top level of one's phone. I often hear people counsel against launching separate apps because of the difficulty of getting adoption of even a single app, but that doesn't mean that separate apps aren't sometimes the most elegant way to deal with the spatial design constraints of mobile.</p><p>On Instagram, content is still largely short in nature so longer narratives aren't common or well-supported. The very structure, oriented around a main feed algorithmically compiling a variety of content from all the account you follow, isn't optimized towards a deep dive into a particular subject matter or narrative like, say, a television or a streaming video app. The closest to long-form on Instagram is Live, but most of what I see of that is only loosely narrative, resembling more an extended selfie than a considered narrative. Rather than pursue long-form narrative, it may be that a more on-brand way to tackle the challenge of lengthening usage of the app is better stringing together of existing content, similar to how Snapchat can aggregate content from one location into a feed of sorts. That can be useful for things like concerts and sporting events and breaking news events like natural disasters, protests, and marches.</p><p>In addition, perhaps there is a general limit to how far a single feed of random content arranged algorithmically can go before we suffer pure consumption exhaustion. Perhaps seeing curated snapshots from everyone will finally push us all to the breaking point of jealousy and FOMO and, across a large enough number of users, an asymptote will emerge.</p><p>However, I suspect we've moved into an age where the upper bound on vanity fatigue has shifted much higher in a way that an older generation might find unseemly. Just as we've moved into a post-scarcity age of information, I believe we've moved into a post-scarcity age of identity as well. And in this world, it's more acceptable to be yourself and leverage social media for maximal distribution of yourself in a way that ties to the fundamental way in which the topology of culture has shifted from a series of massive centralized hub and spokes to a more uniform mesh.</p><p>A last possible asymptote relates to my general sense that massive networks like Facebook and Instagram will, at some point, require more structured interactions and content units (for example, a list is a structured content unit, as is a check-in) to continue scaling. Doing so always imposes some additional friction on the content creator, but the benefit is breaking one monolithic feed into more distinct units, allowing users the ability to shift gears mentally by seeing and anticipating the structure, much like how a magazine is organized.</p><p>To fill gaps in a person's free time, an endless feed is like an endless jar of liquid, able to be poured into any crevice in one's schedule and flow of attention. To demand a person's time, on the other hand, is a higher order task, and more structured content seems to do better on that front. People set aside dedicated time to play games like Fortnite or to watch Netflix, but less so to browse feeds. The latter happens on the fly. But ambition in software-driven Silicon Valley is endless and so at some point every tech company tries to obtain the full complement of Infinity Stones, whether by building them or buying them, like Facebook did with Instagram and Whatsapp.</p><h3>Amazon's next invisible asymptote?</h3><p>I started with Amazon, but it is worth revisiting as it is hardly done with its own ambitions. After having made such massive progress on the shipping fee asymptote, what other barriers to growth might remain?</p><p>On that same topic of shipping, the next natural barrier is shipping speed. Yes, it's great that I don't have to pay for shipping, but in time customer expectations inflate. Per Jeff's latest <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312518121161/d456916dex991.htm\" target=\"_blank\">annual letter to shareholders</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static – they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before. It may be because customers have such easy access to more information than ever before – in only a few seconds and with a couple taps on their phones, customers can read reviews, compare prices from multiple retailers, see whether something’s in stock, find out how fast it will ship or be available for pick-up, and more. These examples are from retail, but I sense that the same customer empowerment phenomenon is happening broadly across everything we do at Amazon and most other industries as well. You cannot rest on your laurels in this world. Customers won’t have it.<br /></p></blockquote><p>Why only two-day shipping for free? What if I want my package tomorrow, or today, or right now?</p><p>Amazon has already been working on this problem for over a decade, building out a higher density network of smaller distribution centers over its previous strategy of fewer, gargantuan distribution hubs. Drone delivery may have sounded like a joke when first announced on an episode of 60 Minutes, but it addresses the same problem, as does a strategy like Amazon lockers in local retail stores.</p><p>Another asymptote may be that while Amazon is great at being the site of first resort to fulfill customer demands for products, it is less capable when it comes to generating desire ex nihilo, the kind of persuasion typically associated more with a tech company like Apple or any number of luxury retailers.</p><p>At Amazon we referred to the dominant style of shopping on the service as spear-fishing. People come in, type a search for the thing they want, and 1-click it. In contrast, if you've ever gone to a mall with someone who loves shopping for shopping's sake, a clotheshorse for example, you'll see a method of shopping more akin to the gathering half of hunting and gathering. Many outfits are picked off the rack and gazed at, held up against oneself in a mirror, turned around and around in the hand for contemplation. Hands brush across racks of clothing, fingers feeling fabric in search of something unknown even to the shopper.</p><p>This is browsing, and Amazon's interface has only solved some aspects of this mode of shopping. If you have some idea what you want, similarities carousels can guide one in some comparison shopping, and customer reviews serve as a voice on the shoulder, but it still feels somewhat utilitarian.</p><p>Amazon's first attempts at physical stores reflect this bias in its retail style. I visited an Amazon physical bookstore in University Village the last time I was in Seattle, and it struck me as the website turned into 3-dimensional space, just with a lot less inventory. Amazon Go sounds more interesting, and I can't wait to try it out, but again, its primary selling point is the self-serve, low-friction aspect of the experience.</p><p>When I think of creating desire, I think of my last and only visit to Milan, when a woman at an Italian luxury brand store talked me into buying a sportcoat I had no idea I wanted when I walked into the store. In fact, it wasn't even on display, so minimal was the inventory when I walked in.</p><p>She looked at me, asked me some questions, then went to the back and walked back out with a single option. She talked me into trying it on, then flattered me with how it made me look, as well as pointing out some of its most distinctive qualities. Slowly, I began to nod in agreement, and eventually I knew I had to be the man this sportcoat would turn me into when it sat on my shoulders.</p><p>This challenge isn't unique to Amazon. Tech companies in general have been mining the scalable ROI of machine learning and algorithms for many years now. More data, better recommendations, better matching of customer to goods, or so the story goes. But what I appreciate about luxury retail, or even Hollywood, is its skill for making you believe that something is the right thing for you, absent previous data. Seduction is a gift, and most people in technology vastly overestimate how much of customer happiness is solvable by data-driven algorithms while underestimating the ROI of seduction.</p><p>Netflix spent $1 million on a prize to improve its recommendation algorithms, and yet it's a daily ritual that millions of people stare at their Netflix home screen, scrolling around for a long time, trying to decide what to watch. It's not just Netflix, open any streaming app. The AppleTV, a media viewing device, is most often praised for its screensaver! That's like admitting you couldn't find anything to eat on a restaurant menu but the typeface was pleasing to the eye. It's not that data can't guide a user towards the right general neighborhood, but more than one tech company will find the gradient of return on good old seduction to be much steeper than they might realize.</p><p>Still, for Amazon, this may not be as dangerous a weakness as it would be for another retailer. Much of what Amazon sells is commodities, and desire generation can be offloaded to other channels who then see customers leak to Amazon for fulfillment. Amazon's logistical and customer service supremacy is a devastatingly powerful advantage because it directly precedes and follows the act of payment in the shopping value chain, allowing it to capture almost all the financial return of commodity retail.</p><p>And, as Jeff's annual letter to shareholders has emphasized from the very first instance, Amazon's mission is to be the world's most customer-centric company. One way to continue to find vectors for growth is to stay attached at the hip to the fickle nature of customer unhappiness, which they're always quite happy to share under the right circumstances, one happy consequence of this age of outrage. There is such a thing as a price umbrella, but there's also one for customer happiness.</p><h3>How to identify your invisible asymptotes</h3><p>One way to identify your invisible asymptotes is to simply ask your customers. As I noted at the start of this piece, at Amazon we honed in on how shipping fees were a brake on our business by simply asking customers and non-customers.</p><p>Here's where the oft-cited quote from Henry Ford is brought up as an objection: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses,\" <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast\" target=\"_blank\">he is reputed to have said</a>. Like most truisms in business, it is snappy and lossy all at once.</p><p>True, it's often difficult for customers to articulate what they want. But what's missed is that they're often much better at pinpointing what they don't want or like. What you should hear when customers say they want a faster horse is not the literal but instead that they find travel by horse to be too slow. The savvy product person can generalize that to the broader need of traveling more quickly, and that problem can be solved any number of ways that don't involve cloning Secretariat or shooting their current horse up with steroids.</p><p>This isn't a foolproof strategy. Sometimes customers lie about what they don't like, and sometimes they can't even articulate their discontent with any clarity, but if you match their feedback with good analysis of customer behavior data and even some well-designed tests, you can usually land on a more accurate picture of the actual problem to solve.</p><p>A popular sentiment in Silicon Valley is that B2C businesses are more difficult product challenges than B2B because products and services for the business customer can be specified merely by talking to the customer while the consumer market is inarticulate about its needs, per the Henry Ford quote. Again, that's only partially true, and so many consumer companies I've been advising recently haven't pushed enough yet on understanding or empathizing with the objections of its non-adopters.</p><p>We speak often of the economics concept of the demand curve, but in product there is another form of demand curve, and that is the contour of the customers' demands of your product or service. How comforting it would be if it were flat, but as Bezos noted in his annual letter to shareholders, the arc of customer demands is long, but it bends ever upwards. It's the job of each company, especially its product team, to continue to be in tune with the topology of this \"demand curve.\"</p><p>I see many companies spend time analyzing funnels and seeing who emerges out the bottom. As a company grows, though, and from the start, it's just as important to look at those who never make it through the funnel, or who jump out of it at the very top. If the product market fit gradient likely differs for each of your current and potential customer segments, and understanding how and why is a never-ending job.</p><p>When companies run focus groups on their products, they often show me the positive feedback. I'm almost invariably more interested in the folks who've registered negative feedback, though I sense many product teams find watching that material to be stomach-churning. Sometimes the feedback isn't useful in the moment; perhaps you have such strong product-market fit with a different cohort that it isn't useful. Still, it's never not a bit of a prick to the ego.</p><p>However, all honest negative feedback forms the basis of some asymptote in some customer segment, even if the constraint isn't constricting yet. Even if companies I meet with don't yet have an idea of how to deal with a problem, I'm always curious to see if they have a good explanation for what that problem is.</p><p>One important sidenote on this topic is that I'm often invited to give product feedback, more than I can find time for these days. When I'm doing so in person, some product teams can't help but jump in as soon as I raise any concerns, just to show they've already anticipated my objections.</p><p>I advise just listening all the way through the first time, to hear the why of someone's feedback, before cutting them off. You'll never be there in person with each customer to talk them out of their reasoning, your product or service has to do that work. The batting average of product people who try to explain to their customers why they're wrong is...not good. It's a sure way to put them off of giving you feedback in the future, too.</p><p>Even absent external feedback, it's possible to train yourself to spot the limits to your product. One approach I've taken when talking to companies who are trying to achieve initial or new product-market fit is to ask them why every person in the world doesn't use their product or service. If you ask yourself that, you'll come up with all sorts of clear answers, and if you keep walking that road you'll find the borders of your TAM taking on greater and greater definition.</p><p>[It's true that you also need the flip side, an almost irrational positivity, to be able to survive the difficult task of product development, or to be an entrepreneur, but selection bias is such that most such people start with a surplus of optimism.]</p><p>Lastly, though I hesitate to share this, it is possible to avoid invisible asymptotes through sheer genius of product intuition. I balk for the same reason I cringe when I meet CEO's in the valley who idolize Steve Jobs. In many ways, a product intuition that is consistently accurate across time is, like Steve Jobs, a unicorn. It's so rare an ability that to lean entirely on it is far more dangerous and high risk than blending it with a whole suite of more accessible strategies.</p><p>It's difficult for product people to hear this because there's something romantic and heroic about the Steve Jobs mythology of creation, brilliant ideas springing from the mind of the mad genius and inventor. However, just to read a biography of Jobs is to understand how rare a set of life experiences and choices shaped him into who he was. Despite that, we've spawned a whole bunch of CEO's who wear the same outfit every day and drive their design teams crazy with nitpick design feedback as if the outward trappings of the man were the essence of his skill. We vastly underestimate the path dependence of his particular style of product intuition.</p><p>Jobs' gift is so rare that it's likely even Apple hasn't been able to replace it. It's not a coincidence that the Apple products that frustrate me the most right now are all the ones with \"Pro\" in the name. The MacBook Pro, with its flawed keyboard and bizarre Touch Bar (I'm still using the old 13\" MacBook Pro with the old keyboard, hoping beyond hope that Apple will come to its senses before it becomes obsolete). The Mac Pro, which took on the unfortunately apropos shape of a trash can in its last incarnation and whose replacement hasn't shipped in years (I'm still typing this at home on an ancient cheese grater Mac Pro tower and ended up building a PC tower to run VR and to do photo and video editing). Final Cut Pro, which I learned on in film editing school, and which got zapped in favor of Final Cut X just when FCP was starting to steal meaningful share in Hollywood from Avid. The iMac Pro, which isn't easily upgradable but great if you're a gazillionaire.</p><p>Pro customers are typically ones with the most clearly specified needs and workflows. Thus, their products are ones for whom listening to them articulate what they want is a reliable path to establishing and maintaining product-market fit. But that's not something Apple seems to enjoy doing, and so the mis-steps they've made on these lines are exactly the types of mistakes you'd expect of them.</p><p>[I was overjoyed to read that Apple's next Mac Pro is being built using <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/\" target=\"_blank\">extensive feedback from media professionals</a>. It's disappointing that it won't arrive until 2019 now but at least Apple has descended from the ivory tower to talk to the actual future users. It's some of the best news out of Apple I've heard in forever.]</p><p>Live by intuition, die by it. It's not surprising that Snapchat, another company that lives by the product intuition of one person, stumbled with a recent redesign. That a company's strengths are its weaknesses is simply the result of tight adherence to methodology. Apple and Snapchat's deus ex machina style of handing down products also rid us of CD-ROM drives and produced the iPhone, AirPods, the camera-first messaging app, and the Story format, among many other breakthroughs which a product person could hang a career on.</p><p>Because products and services live in an increasingly dynamic world, especially those targeted at consumers, they aren't governed by the immutable, timeless truths of a field like mathematics. The reason I recommend a healthy mix of intuition informed by data and feedback is that most product people I know have a product view that is slower moving than the world itself. If they've achieved any measure of success, it's often because their view of some consumer need was the right one at the right time. Product-market fit as tautology. Selection bias in looking at these people might confuse some measure of luck with some enduring product intuition.</p><p>However, just as a VC might have gotten lucky once with some investment and be seen as a genius for life (and the returns to a single buff of a VC brand name is shockingly durable), just because a given person's product intuition might hit on the right moment at the right point in history to create a smash hit, it's rare that a single person's frame will move in lock step with that of the world. How many creatives are relevant for a lifetime?</p><p>This is one reason sustained competitive advantage is so difficult. In the long run, endogenous variance in the quality of product leadership in a company always seems to be in the negative direction. But perhaps we are too focused on management quality and not focused enough on exogenous factors. In \"<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2018/divine-discontent-disruptions-antidote/\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Discontent: Disruption’s Antidote</a>,\" Ben Thompson writes:</p><blockquote><p>Bezos’s letter, though, reveals another advantage of focusing on customers: it makes it impossible to overshoot. When I wrote that piece five years ago, I was thinking of the opportunity provided by a focus on the user experience as if it were an asymptote: one could get ever closer to the ultimate user experience, but never achieve it:<br /></p></blockquote>\n",

      "<blockquote><p>In the case of Amazon, that this unattainable and ever-changing objective is embedded in the company’s culture is, in conjunction with the company’s demonstrated ability to spin up new businesses on the profits of established ones, a sort of perpetual motion machine; I’m not sure that Amazon will beat Apple to $1 trillion, but they surely have the best shot at two.<br /></p></blockquote><p>Pattern recognition is the default operation mode of much of Silicon Valley and other fields, but it is almost always, by its very nature, backwards-looking. One can hardly blame most people for resorting to it because it's a way of minimizing blame, and the economic returns of the Valley are so amplified by the structural advantages of winners that even matching market beta makes for a comfortable living.</p><p>However, if consumer desires are shifting, it's always just a matter of time before pattern recognition leads to an invisible asymptote. One reason startups are often the tip of the spear for innovation in technology is that they can't rely on market beta to just roll along. Achieving product-market fit for them is an existential challenge, and they have no backup plans. Imagine an investor who has to achieve alpha to even survive.</p><p>Companies can stay nimble by turning over its product leaders, but as a product professional, staying relevant to the marketplace is a never-ending job, even if your own life is irreversible and linear. I find the best way to unmoor myself from my most strongly held product beliefs is to increase my inputs. Besides, the older I get, the more I've grown to enjoy that strange dance with the customer. Leading a partner in a dance may give you a feeling of control, but it's a world of difference from dancing by yourself.</p><p>One of my favorite Ben Thompson posts is \"<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\">What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong</a>\" in which he built on Christensen's theory of disruption to note that low end disruption can be avoided if you can differentiate on user experience. It is difficult and perhaps even impossible to over-serve on that axis. Tesla came into the electric car market with a car that was way more expensive than internal combustion engine cars (this definitely wasn't low-end disruption), had shorter range, and required really slow charging at a time when very few public chargers existed yet.</p><p>However, Tesla got an interesting foothold because on another axis it really delivered. Yes, the range allowed for more commuting without having to charge twice a day, but more importantly, for the wealthy, it was a way to signal one's environmental consciousness in a package that was much, much sexier than the Prius, the previous electric car of choice of celebrities in LA. It will be hard for Tesla to continue to rely on that in the long run as the most critical dimension of user experience will likely evolve, but it's a good reminder that \"user experience\" is broad enough to encompass many things, some less measurable than others.</p><p>You can't overserve on user experience, Thompson argues; as a product person, I'd argue, in parallel, that it is difficult and likely impossible to understand your customer too deeply. Amazon's mission to the be the world's most customer-centric company is inherently a long-term strategy because it is a one with an infinite time scale and no asymptote to its slope.</p><p>In my experience, the most successful people I know are much more conscious of their own personal asymptotes at a much earlier age than others. They ruthlessly and expediently flush them out. One successful person I know determined in grade school that she'd never be a world-class tennis player or pianist. Another mentioned to me how, in their freshman year of college, they realized they'd never be the best mathematician in their own dorm, let alone in the world. Another knew a year into a job that he wouldn't be the best programmer at his company and so he switched over into management; he rose to become CEO.</p><p>By discovering their own limitations early, they are also quicker to discover vectors on which they're personally unbounded. Product development will always be a multi-dimensional problem, often frustratingly so, but the value of reducing that dimensionality often costs so little that it should be more widely employed.</p><p>This isn't to say a person needs to aspire to be the best at everything they do. I'm at peace with the fact that I'll likely always be a middling cook, that I won't win the Tour de France, and that I'm destined to be behind a camera and not in front of it. When it comes to business, however, and surviving in the ruthless Hobbesian jungle, where much more is winner-take-all than it once was, the idea that you can be whatever you want to be, or build whatever you want to build, is a sure path to a short, unhappy existence.</p>~\n",
      "<p>I was in Taipei the past few weeks working on a documentary with friends. Because of a busy schedule, it wasn't like my usual travels abroad for fun, it felt more like a work trip. Still, even if I'd been there purely for vacation, I would've wanted to try a different mode of travel, one less focused on eating at nice restaurants or visiting notable tourist destinations and ticking them off the list like some big game hunter hoping to stuff and mount my quarry on Instagram.</p><p>Instead, inspired by my last visit to Italy, in which I spent many weeks wandering cities with knowledgeable locals, listening to them discuss their views on the past, present, and future of their country, culture, and institutions, I've been contemplating how to evolve my travel approach to gather more than just photos and memories.</p><p>I didn't have time to really put this fully into practice this trip.

      "<p>In the comments on my photo, a friend asked me where all the trash in Taipei went? Indeed, I didn't see trash piled up on the sidewalks, or anywhere in public. In fact, much of the trip I couldn't even find a public trash can in which to throw out empty boba tea cups or the plastic wrap around whatever snack from 7-11 I'd just inhaled during a break in shooting. Why were there so few trash cans, and where was all the trash? That mystery led me down a rabbit hole.</p><p>I happened to interview some government officials for the documentary, and after those would wind down, or during breaks, I asked some of them to talk about trash collection in Taipei. They gave me an overview, the details of which I filled in online.</p><p>Like New York City, Taiwan once had trash piled up on sidewalks awaiting collection. As anyone who's ever wandered through New York City in the summer, huge heaps of trash on sidewalks, baking in the humid summer heat, are one of the city's least attractive features. It's not just the stench or the reduced sidewalk surface for pedestrians but the occasional rat nearly scurrying over one's feet that can induce regular surges of revulsion and horror.</p><p>New York City doesn't have many alleys. In contrast, if you've ever been to Chicago, you'll encounter many alleys between city buildings, and rather than pile trash on sidewalks, residents and businesses stash it in trash bins sitting in those alleys.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/shows/curious-city/shadow-city-how-chicago-became-the-countrys-alley-capital/3f2b1e3d-f5f2-49c2-a3b8-8fb3fceacdc4\" target=\"_blank\">How is it that Chicago has alleys and New York does not</a>?</p><blockquote>According to Michael Martin, alley expert and professor of landscape architecture at Iowa State University, the “why alleys” question is easy to answer. You just have to go back to the late 1700s, decades before Chicago was founded. America was young, and had hardly touched any of its newest territories to the west.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>“There's one thing you can do without having to explore all of it,” says Martin. “Lay a grid over that giant swath of land, and divide it up in ways that you can then take that land and you can sell it, you can deed it over to people.”<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The federal government’s National Land Ordinance of 1785 imposed a massive grid over everything west of the Ohio River, dividing uncharted territory into square townships, each 36 square miles in size. Those townships were then sliced into progressively smaller sections, all the way down to the city block.&nbsp;<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>“As you think about finer and finer scales of design, what's happening is those squares are being infilled and infilled,” says Martin. “The big grid was always the framework within which people developed things, and that leads to towns having square blocks, and ultimately the alley inside of that block.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </blockquote><p>Path dependence of development has a time dimension that impacts many aspects of the world, one of the things travel is good at teasing out. New York City was built earlier than Chicago. By the time it was time to develop Chicago, the grid design style had become prevalent.</p><blockquote>The particulars came into play with the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal. In the 1820s, the U.S. Congress had granted the state of Illinois enough land to dig a canal to connect Lake Michigan and the Illinois River. The state planned to finance the construction by establishing towns along the canal and selling the land to developers.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The I&amp;M Canal Commission hired surveyor James Thompson to lay out Chicago at the eastern end of the canal in 1830. To attract prospective land buyers, the General Assembly ordered that the new town of Chicago be “subdivided into town lots, streets, and alleys, as in their best judgment will best promote the interest of the said canal fund.”<br /> </blockquote><p>In the American consciousness and pop culture, the alley is a place of danger and grime. It's where Bruce Wayne's parents were shot and Batman birthed, a place of drug deals, prostitution, gang fights, and dumpsters. This squalid reputation may trace back to the functional roots of the alley in America.</p><blockquote>The city [Chicago] was a filthy, stinky, disease-ridden place in those days. Rear service lanes were essential for collecting trash, delivering coal, and stowing human waste — basically, keeping anything unpleasant away from living quarters.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>“This was one of the reason why alleys have this dark and nasty reputation,” says Martin. “They were very much the grimy service part of daily life. It wasn't expected that this would be a well-maintained landscape; it was kind of a landscape of raw utility.”<br /> </blockquote><p>Despite that, alleys do offer Chicago a place to stow trash that in NYC would pile up on sidewalks. However, Taipei has alleys that don't house trash dumpsters and are an improvement, to my mind, over Chicago alleys in their contribution to civic life. How does Taipei manage it?</p><p>Once, like New York City, Taipei had trash piled up in public, the stench of trash stewing in the tropical weather permeating the city and attracting rats. In an effort to remove this highly visible trapping of third world status, the government made a concerted effort starting in the mid-80's to <a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/separation-anxiety/\" target=\"_blank\">overhaul</a> their trash collection policies.</p><blockquote>“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BCr_Elise\">Für Elise</a>”&nbsp;is one of the world’s most widely-recognized pieces of music. The Beethoven melody has been played by pianists the world over, and its near-universal recognition has been used to attract customers for companies as big as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2yklZeEbFE\">McDonald’s</a> and as small as your local ice-cream truck. But if you hear the song playing on the streets of Taiwan, accompanied by the low grumble of an engine, the only ice-cream you’ll find if you follow the tune will be the soupy remains of a neighbor’s Häagen-Dazs. In Taiwan, “Für Elise” means it is time to take out your trash. Directly out to the truck. Yourself.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>In the capital city of Taipei, trucks play two different songs along their garbage-routes (the other one is “A Maiden’s Prayer” by composer Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska).<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Five nights a week,&nbsp;Taipei residents head to out to designated street corners, where the yellow garbage trucks will stop for a few minutes (and turn off their music), so that people toss their bags of trash in themselves.<br /> </blockquote><p>Having shot a documentary outdoors for almost two weeks in Taipei, I'm by now well-acquainted with these garbage trucks. It's a nightmare for sound recording as the musical chimes from the trucks makes it very difficult to edit around footage in post.</p><p>However, seeing citizens lining the sidewalks, official government required blue trash bags in hand, was a remarkable vision of civic cooperation. The idea that trash collection would occur multiple times a day, five or six times a week, is stunning to this American. In effect, Taiwan moved to a just-in-time trash collection system. As noted in this <a href=\"https://www.buzzworthy.com/taiwan-garbage-disposal/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>:</p><blockquote>This ‘trash-doesn’t-touch-the-ground’ system makes each person responsible for his or her personal consumption. Every plastic fork, every bottled beverage, and every food scrap needs to be accounted for by its consumer. The implementation of a few clever policies encourages this new relationship with trash.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>It’s compulsory for the people of Taiwan to use a special blue ‘City of Taipei’ garbage bag to dispose of general waste. They’re available at most corner stores and come in different sizes, ranging from 3 to 120 liters. On the other hand, recycling is free and can be brought to the truck in any kind of bag.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>This encourages people to recycle more and produce less trash.<br /> </blockquote><p>What did this have to do with the paucity of public trash receptacles which also forced me to carry plastic wrappers and bottles in my pocket as we wandered around the city? City officials discovered that citizens had been skirting recycling mandates by dumping things in public trash bins. To increase recycling compliance, the government removed public trash receptacles, conducted occasional audits of trash and recycling when the trucks came by, and started posting videos of and fining violators.</p><p>All together, these policies have been remarkably effective.</p><blockquote>[Taiwan was]&nbsp; producing 3,296 tonnes per day and recycling only 5% of it. Today, they have reduced that number by more than 2/3, of which they recycle an impressive 55%.<br /> </blockquote><p>The difference in philosophy and ownership of trash collection between the United States and Taiwan is striking.</p><blockquote>The difference between Taiwan and other nations is the way waste management sits in the public’s consciousness. In the US, waste management is run by private companies. Companies place the emphasis on quality of service, aiming to reduce the burden on the consumer.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>People don’t have to think about the amount of trash they produce – once it’s in the can, it’s no longer their responsibility. Garbage trucks come in the dead hour of the night or during office hours, to be as inconspicuous as possible.<br /> </blockquote><p>For some problems, achieving a breakthrough requires a holistic solution, with interlinked policies as Taiwan implemented to avoid any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect\" target=\"_blank\">Cobra effects</a>.</p><p>It depresses me to think of San Francisco's reactionary, incrementalist governance in comparison. The MTA recently voted unanimously <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Scooter-skirmish-City-ready-to-place-limits-on-12878761.php\" target=\"_blank\">to cap the number of total electric scooters in the city to 1,250 for the first year of testing</a>. That's among five different rental companies.</p><p>I don't mind that government agencies implement codes and regulations; some policies save lives, like earthquake and fire building codes. But the incrementalist approach likely dooms the city to a series of local maximums at best, and at worst locks out all the dynamic improvements that characterize the most vibrant systems.</p><p>Electric scooters might be a wonderful addition to the city's transportation options, but it's something that needs to be tested at scale because it's a solution that depends on scale for a good customer experience. I've tried to take electric scooters a few times, and either the nearest one is too far away, or the one I walk up to has a dead battery. If you limit the number of scooters during a test you might as well just ban them.</p><p>A much more vibrant and livable San Francisco likely involves something like 25-50% fewer cars, sidewalks 50% wider, buildings 50% taller, twice the population density, and 25X the number of electric scooters, just to throw out some back of the envelope guesses of enough magnitude to alter one's conception of the city in a significant way. But no incrementalist approach will get the city there.</p>~\n",
      "<p>In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/matt-levine-tyler-cowen-finance-bitcoin-19e380b7430\" target=\"_blank\">conversation with Matt Levine</a>, Tyler Cowen asks:</p><blockquote><strong>COWEN:</strong> Like you, I’m mostly an efficient markets guy, but when I look at initial public offerings I’m very baffled because investment banks take such a huge cut.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>If you needed to argue, “Well, they need the cut because they talk up the security, and in the absence of their efforts, no one would be interested, and it’s worth it,” maybe that argument works. But it seems somewhat to stand in tension with an efficient markets hypothesis, which suggests the thing will find its appropriate level without any particular investor having to talk it up.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, attempts to get around the current mainstream system of IPOs have not always been successful. Auctions have been tried. Israel has tried other methods. Spotify is giving it a go. We’ll get further data, but they’re not obviously doing better.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>How do you reconcile IPOs in their current form continuing, the investment banks taking such a huge cut, <em>and</em> some version of efficient markets hypothesis actually making sense? Do you see what I’m asking?<br /> </blockquote><p>I wasn't at Amazon for its IPO, but I did work on a huge convertible debt offering there. At the time it was the largest ever done. After the transaction had cleared, I received a box at work from Morgan Stanley, who'd been our banker on the deal. Inside was a Tumi carry-on bag, personalized with Amazon and Morgan Stanley logos. Everyone on our side who worked on the deal received one. My guess was the bag retailed for $500 or so without the personalization.</p><p>It's always an ambivalent feeling, receiving such a pricey gift from a business partner after a deal. I've received similar customized luggage from law firms after their assistance on something. It feels as if you bought yourself something you didn't want. I generally believe in efficient markets, but I believe even more strongly that law firms and bankers don't do anything out of affectionate generosity. Call it the efficient business transaction hypothesis, in which you always pay for every bit of service rendered. There's a reason you don't receive a Tumi bag from your dry cleaner after laundering a big batch of shirts.</p><p>So, as with Cowen, I've long puzzled at the exorbitant take on the part of bankers in deals, regardless of the volume of work done.</p><p>Levine answers:</p><blockquote><strong>LEVINE:</strong> How do I reconcile? One version of efficient markets is that, in the absence of news, the price yesterday is going to be the price today, or whatever. There’s some sort of continuity of prices.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The IPO is a huge discontinuity. You don’t have a price and then you have a price. If your notion of efficient markets is a straight line of the price not moving very much or of the price instantly incorporating information, it’s not unintuitive that you’d have a big squiggle at the start, that you wouldn’t really know what the price is for three days, and then you would.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>I don’t think it’s unusual that the first trade of a stock would not be the price that it settles to in a week, but then, the second week would be pretty close to the first week.<br /> </blockquote><p>A good answer, but the word \"discontinuity\" hints at another aspect of this type of transaction which hints at why an IPO may not exhibit aspects of an efficient market.</p><p>I long wondered the same of the real estate market, another space in which real estate agents have been able to maintain their 6% rake despite the advent of the internet. It's a bit of a puzzle considering how many other markets the internet has turned so efficient that almost all the profits went out of them.</p><p>There's a class of transactions which retain abnormally large margins which share several qualities.</p><ul><li>They are rare, or infrequent transactions for one side, usually the buyer. Many people may only conduct one of these in their lifetime.</li><li>They are really large relative to most transactions in a person's lifetime, anomalously so.</li><li>They don't have well-known price anchors, often because the service is good is unique, making exact comps squishy.</li><li>They are transactions which have some symbolic or mystical value which can justify overspending because how do you put a price on magic?</li><li>They are time sensitive.</li></ul><p>Let's take those in order. The low frequency of such transactions weighs in favor of the seller, not the buyer, because the buyer has no experience. IPOs, housing purchases, weddings. The experience asymmetry is really information asymmetry. One should always be skeptical of playing any game where your opponent has to explain all the rules to you. The three card monte and other cons always begin with the con man explaining the game to you, no?</p><p>The anomalous size of the transaction works against you in several ways. One, when so much money is involved, one tends to experience inflation on all fronts. If you're buying a condo that costs a million dollars, or, in the case of San Francisco, a lot more than that, what's another couple hundred dollars in fees here, a few thousand there? In the scheme of things, 6% to your agent doesn't even cross the mind after you've been beaten out on several dream condos in a row by a suitcase of cash from a Chinese buyer who never even showed up. Relative to the transaction size, it's nothing. Human cognitive deficiencies on this front are well-studied.</p><p>The lack of price anchors doesn't help. What should a wedding dress cost? You can ask your friends, but, to crib from the Marines, \"This is my wedding dress.&nbsp;There are many like it,&nbsp;but this one is mine. It is my life.\"</p><p>Buying cars is also a rare transaction, but it's unlikely you're buying a car model that's never been purchased before. As soon as the internet revealed dealer pricing, it was easy to just call a string of dealers around town and offer to pay $500 over that, nothing more.</p><p>The special nature of such transactions supports a \"je ne sais quoi\" premium. Are you really going to skimp on your IPO, or pinch pennies when it comes to your wedding? I know brides who would sooner cut dinner from the wedding festivities than skimp on their wedding dress. If the event has symbolic value, then almost any price can be justified to oneself. Different cultures support different such mystical price premiums. In the United States, people will spend to no end on their dogs, for example. It's the same for babies or children in many cultures. Are you really going to try to save a hundred dollars or so on a stroller which will transport your precious child for several of their formative years, or not pay the $25,000 tuition for your potentially genius of a child to attend the coveted private school every one is trying to get into?</p><p>The time-bounded nature of such transactions just prevents you, as the buyer, from using a long time horizon for leverage. Sellers, of course, will use the time bound as a cudgel in every way possible. If you don't nibble they have many more transactions to come, but you as the buyer have no such luck. The wedding invites have been sent, your investors are eagerly awaiting your IPO, you need to secure housing before your current lease runs out.</p><p>The internet has, in many ways, ushered in an age in which old axioms of supply and demand economics aren't always applicable, or which make edge cases commonplace. Infinite supply, zero marginal transaction costs (especially in production and distribution), these are suddenly prevalent. It's almost nostalgic, therefore, to ponder the economics of infrequent transactions, or of markets where supply is fixed (the limited edition sneaker market, for example, or the Bay Area housing market).</p><p>The high margins prevalent in large, infrequent transactions suggest that businesses might create some moats simply by replicating some of the qualities of such transactions, even if the underlying businesses don't consist of those. What is subscription pricing but a way of grouping many, frequent transactions into many infrequent transactions where it's difficult to determine the unit cost of all the components of the bundle? I suspect half the reason for the phenomenon in which tech oscillates between bundling and unbundling is to find the efficient size of the bundle that the consumer will bear. We won't all have dozens of Patreon accounts that we support in the future, but neither will we pay $300 a month for some mega video streaming bundle that includes everything under the sun.</p><p>Every transaction is a moment for a buyer to reconsider whether it's all worthwhile. At some point, I expect many newspaper will band together to offer some bundled subscriptions. Magazines already have tried this but the very concept of a magazine, and the typical frequency of issues (monthly) is difficult to construct a high value bundle around as compared to newspapers.</p><p>I also suspect that the ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft will continue to experiment with some sort of monthly fee with unlimited rides within reason (perhaps with mileage overage payments). Uber has already experimented with offering pre-payments for a bundle of fixed price rides for a month, and I expect that's just the first step towards some sort of lock-in car-as-a-service subscription pricing. It's exhausting to duke it out with competitors one ride at a time, and it trains buyers to shop for the best price on each ride, something that's easier than ever given that both services' apps allow you to enter your destination to see the price ahead of booking a car.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The re-bundling begins. <a href=\"https://t.co/CJxkHwuOVl\">https://t.co/CJxkHwuOVl</a><br /><br />I’m surprised we haven’t seen more offers like this, e.g. Headspace+Strava/Runkeeper, NYTimes/WashPo, or LeaguePass/MLB.tv</p>— Eugene Wei (@eugenewei) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/985220777254404096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2018</a></blockquote>\n",
      "<p>Let's suppose that consumers do possess some limit to the number of transactions they're willing to put up, some finite cognitive load for payments. If so, then any seller must consider the number of other subscriptions in the marketplace when understanding how well their own bundle will do. And in that case, we should start to see more bundles of bundles. In the tweet above I suggest a few, there are likely many others.</p><p>The problem with creating bundles of bundles is divvying up the credit. It's unlikely all components of the bundle contribute equally, so the highest value component is typically hesitant to join in. However, in the digital age, assigning credit is much simpler. So, just as ESPN earns much higher carriage fees in the cable bundle than, say, Comedy Central, can be done with exact usage figures in real time.</p><p>The funniest example of the efficiency of bundling (well, it is to me since I don't have kids) is the division of childcare. When I'm around parents, it's somewhat striking how much of a constant low-level tension arises from splitting up such duties. Whose turn is it to change a diaper, or to go hold a crying baby? With the exception of the wealthy who can afford full-time childcare help, such tasks are among the most frequently occurring transactions in adult life. Each is a moment of negotiation, and thus an opportunity for friction.</p><p>Thus, parents come up with long-term divisions that reduce the number of such transactions. Sometimes it's an agreement that the dad handles all dishes and diaper changes while the mom does all the feeding and crying. Parents also will come up with bundles which they trade, to reduce the overall number of negotiations. The husband get to go on a guys golf trip for a week, but later that year, the mother gets a girls trip to Palm Springs.</p><p>Sometimes efficiency is just household equilibrium, and you can't put a price on that type of harmony.</p>~\n",
      "<p>It has been some time since I posted here. Outside of lots of meetings around the country and some trips with family and friends, a few creative projects have stolen the lion's share of my free time.</p><p>While I won't publish some Medium screed on how spending less time on social media transformed my life, it is an unavoidable truth that one's free time is a zero sum game. For infovores, Twitter is a bit like heroin, and for all the other gaps in one's time, other social media apps are like some Cerebro-like viscous membrane that gives off a mild contact high from the vibrations of ambient social intimacy.</p><p>As presently constructed, though, all these apps are certainly well into the point of diminishing returns for me, and so less time spent there, redirected offline, has been good for my general productivity and well-being. I'm not certain, but it seems that's it not a question of mix as it is of finding the optimal frequency for all the various activities in my life. To take one example, almost certainly I see huge returns to shifting conversations with folks on Twitter offline.</p><p>Some of that time has been spent continuing to wend my way through Emily Wilson's brilliant new translation of <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2G8PQu7\" target=\"_blank\">The Odyssey</a>. What's fascinating is how it remains resonant with modern times, speaking to its universality. Ironically, what it reminded me of, perhaps because the topic was still top of mind, was social media.</p><p>Take the famous episode in which Odysseus and his men sail past the Sirens and then between Scylla and Charybdis. What surprised me was how short the entire episode is, only occupying a few pages in Book 12, titled \"Difficult Choices.\"</p><p>The goddess Circe gives Odysseus a preview of what he and his men are about to encounter.</p><blockquote>First you will reach the Sirens, who bewitch<br />all passersby. If anyone goes near them<br />in ignorance, and listens to their voices,<br />that man will never travel to his home,<br />and never make his wife and children happy<br />to have him back with them again.<br /> </blockquote><p>\"If anyone goes near them in ignorance, and listens to their voices...\" But this is what happens on social media all the time! Never have we dilettantes in just about every subject had such a forum to lord our \"expertise\" over others. Circe warned us long ago what would happen, how insufferable we'd all be to our loved ones.</p><p>The song of the Sirens is irresistible, and Circe knows it, so she advises Odysseus thus:</p><blockquote>...Around about them lie<br />great heaps of men, flesh rotting from their bones,<br />their skin all shriveled up. Use wax to plug<br />your sailors’ ears as you row past, so they<br />are deaf to them. But if you wish to hear them,<br />your men must fasten you to your ship’s mast<br />by hand and foot, straight upright, with tight ropes.<br />So bound, you can enjoy the Sirens’ song.<br /> </blockquote><p>It's as if Circe is speaking to my irresistible urge to open and read Twitter at the slightest hint of boredom, warning me of the great heaps of men, flesh rotting from their bones, who'd done so before me. As for her firm guidance that Odysseus be bound to a mast? That's just the antecedent to today's \"Never tweet.\"</p><p>Thus, in my moments of weakness, I open Twitter but bind myself to a metaphoric ship's mast so I cannot reply to the trolls, as tempting as it is to join the chorus of people letting their outrage loose. Some days it feels to me that half my timeline is just people posting witty and savage rejoinders to Tomi Lahren or Trump or Dana Loesch and so on. Twitter should just move all of that to a separate tab, it has become a sort of performance art.</p><p>Alexis Madrigal wrote of how he <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/the-case-against-retweets/554078/\" target=\"_blank\">turned off retweets in his Twitter timeline</a> and it improved for him.</p><blockquote>Retweets make up more than a quarter of all tweets. When they disappeared, my feed had less punch-the-button outrage. Fewer mean screenshots of somebody saying precisely the wrong thing. Less repetition of big, big news. Fewer memes I’d already seen a hundred times. Less breathlessness. And more of what the people I follow were actually thinking about, reading, and doing. It’s still not perfect, but it’s much better.<br /> </blockquote><p>Farhad Manjoo wrote that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html\" target=\"_blank\">for two months he got his news only from print</a>.</p><blockquote>It has been life changing. Turning off the buzzing breaking-news machine I carry in my pocket was like unshackling myself from a monster who had me on speed dial, always ready to break into my day with half-baked bulletins.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Now I am not just less anxious and less addicted to the news, I am more widely informed (though there are some blind spots). And I’m embarrassed about how much free time I have — in two months, I managed to read half a dozen books, took up pottery and (I think) became a more attentive husband and father.<br /> </blockquote><p>Is this much different than Circe urging Odysseus to plug his mens' ears with wax? Homer got there first. I am weak so I have not gone full cold turkey on social media.&nbsp;Instead, I am still occasionally there, tied to the mast, flailing against self-administered bonds, listening to the Siren song. May the gods help me.</p><p>[Wilson herself recently posted a series of tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyRCWilson/status/970406691375378432\" target=\"_blank\">observing something else intriguing about the Sirens, the idea that they were some sexy seductresses</a>. Reading Wilson's translation, you realize there is no mention of the Sirens' appearances. The seduction is all in their song, and that makes them an even more appropriate metaphor for social media.]&nbsp;</p><p>After the Sirens, Odysseus and his men meet even more formidable adversaries. Circe foretells of an inescapable passage between Scylla and Charybdis, the original rock and a hard place. There, she says, it's best to pick the lesser of two evils and to sail closer to Scylla, a twelve-legged six-headed monster who will eat six of his men. It sounds terrible, but the alternative is allowing Charybdis to swallow his entire ship. For my money, it's the most famous leadership parable about minimizing one's losses.</p><p>Odysseus, upon hearing this, pleads to no avail.</p><blockquote>I answered, ‘Goddess, please,<br />tell me the truth: is there no other way?<br />Or can I somehow circumvent Charybdis<br />and stop that Scylla when she tries to kill<br />my men?’<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The goddess answered, ‘No, you fool!<br />Your mind is still obsessed with deeds of war.<br />But now you must surrender to the gods.<br />She is not mortal. She is deathless evil,<br />terrible, wild and cruel. You cannot fight her.<br />The best solution and the only way<br />is flight.<br /> </blockquote><p>Is Circe the best life coach, or the best life coach? She's the original Tony Robbins.</p><p>Can you read social media and emerge with your senses and emotional well-being intact? \"No you fool!\" We may not be able to avoid it, but at least we can heed Circe's words. \"The best solution and the only way is flight.\"</p><p>Odysseus and his men proceed as Circe warns, and, tied to the mast, our titular hero hears the song of the Sirens.</p><blockquote>‘Odysseus! Come here! You are well-known<br />from many stories! Glory of the Greeks!<br />Now stop your ship and listen to our voices.<br />All those who pass this way hear honeyed song,<br />poured from our mouths. The music brings them joy,<br />and they go on their way with greater knowledge,<br />since we know everything the Greeks and Trojans<br />suffered in Troy, by gods’ will; and we know<br />whatever happens anywhere on earth.’<br /><br /><br />Their song was so melodious, I longed<br />to listen more. I told my men to free me.<br />I scowled at them, but they kept rowing on.<br /> </blockquote><p>What is this but the siren song of Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and all the other addictive apps on our phones, luring us with the comforting and self-affirming dopamine hits of likes and followers and readers. \"...they go on their way with great knowledge since we know everything...and we know whatever happens anywhere on earth\" is nothing if not the tagline for Twitter written in another age (copyright Homer).</p><p>\"Their song was so melodious, I longed to listen more.\" My Siren is my iPhone, always within arms reach, always with the promise of \"greater knowledge.\" Have I been disciplined and avoided its call? Not always. And like Odysseus, who does end up losing six men to Scylla, I've lost a few chunks of flesh along the way.</p><p>I do have a few long posts incubating, however, which I hope to finish soon. In the meantime, a bit of catch up.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>I was lucky enough to be invited onto two podcasts, both of which were recorded in person during my recent trip to New York City for meetings and to visit family. The first was <a href=\"https://rad.family/eugene-wei-remains-of-the-day/\" target=\"_blank\">Khe Hy's Rad Awakenings podcast</a>. The second was the <a href=\"http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2018/03/amazon-hulu-and-oculus-with-eugene-wei/\" target=\"_blank\">Internet History Podcast</a> hosted by Brian McCullough. I didn't have a book or anything to promote, so they're both a bit free-ranging, as I am here. Check them out if you're interested and let me know what you think.</p><p>It's fascinating to watch the explosion in podcasts, and it's somewhat apparent when you see how easy it is to record one with just a computer and two small microphones. Given the economics of text are so lousy, and given how challenging it is to produce compelling video, the most lucrative vector for media companies is not a pivot to video but a pivot to podcasting. Every day it seems a media company is releasing a new daily news podcast recap.</p><p>In time, the marginal return will decline, but perhaps not before we see a second wave of growth in podcasting's total addressable market (TAM) from improved discovery (the first explosion in podcasting TAM was, of course, the rise of the smartphone, which opened up a ton of podcast surface area in one's daily schedule, most notably in commutes).</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>I kid not, one of the most fascinating videos I've watched since I last posted here was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pzHpi4kE0w\" target=\"_blank\">this episode of Trashcast discussing Logan Paul</a>. For some reason the original version of this video was pulled by YouTube so as of right now, this newly uploaded version has all of...63 views. It taught me more about the Logan Paul phenomenon than anything else I've read or watched, and its presentation is of a style that is extremely meta, like a young person's Vox explainer.</p><p>The temptation, when something like the Logan Paul scandal drops, is to post \"Who the f*** is [Logan Paul]?\" on Twitter or Facebook. I saw probably a dozen or more such posts, and while I resisted the urge, I myself had no idea who Logan Paul was until he was the latest person to take his turn in the public <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillory\" target=\"_blank\">pillory</a>.</p><p>I'm less interested in Logan Paul than I am in all the superstar vloggers who can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzCsM1vtn78\" target=\"_blank\">turn out audiences of tens of thousands young kids everywhere they go</a>. Their particular pull to children of that age, the visual grammar of their content, the syntax of their speech, their distribution frequency, it's all quite instructive.</p><p>One can read near-future sci-fi, or one can just spend some time with some of today's youth, who already live in the near-future. The latter is much more vivid. I spent several hours watching my nephews play Fortnite and message on Snapchat and surf on Instagram while in NYC recently, and it was as if I'd crossed over through some alien border into a cultural <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80206300\" target=\"_blank\">Shimmer</a>. As with Natalie Portman, every one of my visits there leaves me altered in some inexorable ways.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/1/9/outdated-playbooks-from-the-age-of-scarcity\" target=\"_blank\">One of my recent (okay, not so recent) posts</a> was on the shift in entertainment from the shift to infinite content supply. I opened with a brief discussion of Will Smith.</p><p>A few readers sent me a link to this <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bookmark/will-smith-adam-sandler-how-sony-suffered-collapse-a-list-star-book-excerpt-1088418\" target=\"_blank\">excerpt</a> from Ben Fritz's new book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2IDIbSQ\" target=\"_blank\">The Big Picture: The Fight For the Future of Movies</a>. The excerpt is about the rise and fall of the A-List movie stars Will Smith and Adam Sandler during Sony's motion picture heyday in the 2000's.</p><blockquote>Of Sony's top 50 movies from 2000 to 2016, more than two-thirds were \"star vehicles,\" in which the talent involved was as big as or bigger than the movie title or the franchise. More than one-third came from just two people: Will Smith and Adam Sandler. Movies they starred in or produced grossed $3.7 billion from 2000 to 2015, generating 20 percent of Sony Pictures' domestic gross and 23 percent of its profits. No other studio was as reliant on just two actors. Their rise and fall illustrate what has happened to movie stars in Hollywood.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>...<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Sony paid both stars handsomely for their consistent success: $20 million against 20 percent of the gross receipts, whichever was higher, was their standard. They also received as much as $5 million against 5 percent for their production companies, where they employed family and friends. Sony also provided Overbrook and Sandler's Happy Madison with a generous overhead to cover expenses — worth about $4 million per year. To top it off, Sandler and Smith enjoyed the perks of the luxe studio life. Flights on a corporate jet were common. On occasion, Smith's entourage necessitated the use of two jets for travel to premieres. Knowing that Sandler was a huge sports fan, Sony regularly sent him and his pals to the Super Bowl to do publicity. Back at the Sony lot, the basketball court was renamed Happy Madison Square Garden in the star's honor. When anybody questioned the endless indulgence given to Sandler and Smith, Sony executives had a standard answer: \"Will and Adam bought our houses.\"<br /> </blockquote><p>I wrote:</p><blockquote>I'm wary of all conclusions drawn about media in the scarcity age, including the idea that people went to see movies because of movie stars. It's not that Will Smith isn't charismatic. He is. But I suspect Will Smith was in a lot of hits in the age of scarcity in large part because there weren't a lot of other entertainment options vying for people's attention when Independence Day or something of its ilk came out, like clockwork, to launch the summer blockbuster season.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The same goes for the general idea that any one star was ever the chief engine for a film's box office. If the idea that people go see a movie just to see any one star was never actually true, we can stop holding the modern generation of movie stars to an impossible standard.<br /> </blockquote><p>Of course, this is a counterfactual, so hard to establish conclusively. Perhaps, in the age of scarcity, A-List stars really did exist. Regardless, that age has passed, and banking on its continued viability is a shaky proposition at best.</p><p>A further thought, which I first made in a presentation at a Greylock Product Summit a few years back, is that the rising supply of content means that exceeding the noise floor favors a different type of film or television property. In the heyday of the three and eventually four major networks, the golden age of broadcast television, the dream show was one with broad appeal. The economics of television were heavily dependent on advertising revenue, and the larger the audience, the larger the revenue. A show like The Cosby Show or The Beverly Hillbillies, that attracted a broad audience through a sort of non-offensive if somewhat bland sensibility was the dream.</p><p>Again, though, it's important to recall how scarce entertainment options were in that age relative to today's cornucopia. It isn't just the economics of carriage fees and pay TV that helped drive the rise of much more distinctive and niche appeal shows like Mad Men; it's what you'd expect when the overall information noise floor rises. The risk of trying to make a broad appeal show is that it is mildly appealing to many people but not strongly appealing to any audience segment, and that is a losing strategy if the noise floor is so high that only high appeal shows can poke their head above it.</p><p>Is it any surprise that two of the most successful showrunners in recent history are Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy? Watch any of their programs and, whether you like them or not, you won't fault them for pulling their punches.&nbsp;Scandal, How to Get Away With Murder, American Horror Story, Nip/Tuck, Glee, The People Vs. O.J. Simpson, these are programs that are engineered to mash people's buttons.</p><p>Two of the bigger hits of recent memory that aren't from either of those two showrunners are&nbsp; Empire and This is Us. The former was, like many of Rhimes and Murphy's shows, crazy. Double crosses, murders, affairs, all of it. Cray cray. As for This is Us, I watched two episodes with my sister-in-law while in NYC, and while it might seem to fit the template of a more classic, broad appeal broadcast network show, it is bonkers in its own way. Its genre is melodrama, and the episode design is a tear-jerker in every episode. Every one. No exceptions. If you are a writer on that show and your episode doesn't the audience cry they fire you and then everyone has a good cry over it.</p><p>In a world of infinite content, the ideal bundle, then, isn't a basket of broadly appealing programs, something that may be impossible to engineer anymore. Instead, it's a bundle of shows with very strong niche appeal to particular but different audience segments. This, as many of you will note, is not some new concept. The conditions have just made it a more critical one.</p><p>In the Hollywood Reporter, Marc Bernardin observes the success of films like Wonder Woman, Get Out, Black Panther, and Coco, and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-panther-will-african-american-films-no-longer-be-considered-unicorns-1087823\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a>:</p><blockquote>No, the reason we're in the midst of a halcyon age of representational storytelling that's resonating on a historic scale is that a far more diverse pool of storytellers — black filmmakers, female filmmakers, Asian filmmakers — are getting empowered to tell their stories their way with all the resources usually reserved for white, male creatives.&nbsp;<em>Black Panther</em>&nbsp;isn't just the story of a handsome prince taking the throne of a fictional, advanced African nation, it's also the story of a filmmaker reckoning with the disconnect that lives in the hyphen between \"African\" and \"American.\" It's about a man who grew up around women of strength and grace and power who didn't think twice about populating both his art and his set with those same kinds of women. It's about a kid from Oakland dreaming dreams that the world told him he couldn't.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Similarly,&nbsp;<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>&nbsp;would never have been both a balls-out buddy comedy with a perfectly timed anus joke and a trenchant examination of the paved-over sins of colonial expansion without the half-Maori New Zealander Taika Waititi at the helm. And we have proof positive of how Jenkins' centering of Diana in <em>Wonder Woman</em>&nbsp;is different from Zack Snyder's treatment of the same character in <em>Justice League</em>: More openness, innocence and resolve … fewer gratuitous shots of Gal Gadot's ass.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>And there's no one who could've conceived of <em>Get Out</em>&nbsp;but Peele, who spent years exploring the ways race and genre collide on TV's <em>Key &amp; Peele</em>, is a student of horror and has definitely found himself navigating the frothy waters of meeting a white girlfriend's parents for the first time.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The way forward isn't simply to decide to greenlight stories about diverse people. It's to cultivate a generation of writers, directors and producers who see the world through their own unique lens and then bring that perspective to bear. If Marvel didn't have someone like Nate Moore in its producer ranks, someone who knew who T'Challa was and what he could mean, you'd never get a <em>Black Panther</em>. If Pixar didn't elevate story artist Adrian Molina to co-director and co-writer,&nbsp;<em>Coco</em>&nbsp;might've seemed more like a Day of the Dead theme park ride than a haunting, heartbreaking exaltation of Dia de los Muertos.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>What audiences are responding to, in every movie that's popped in the past year, is a sense of truth. Just as we can tell, somehow, when CG is spackled on a little too heavily, we can sense when something feels inauthentic. We can tell the difference between <em>12 Years a Slave</em>&nbsp;and <em>Amistad</em>, between <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>&nbsp;and <em>The Last Samurai</em>, between <em>Selma</em>&nbsp;and <em>Mississippi Burning</em>. One of them feels true — and truth, ultimately, is what makes something universal.<br /> </blockquote><p>I believe in the power of film as a medium, and so it's no surprise that I believe in the underrated power of representation. It's not underrated by those of us who've never seen ourselves on screen, but I recall talking to some white men about Wonder Woman, and they remarked how they didn't see what the fuss was about. I couldn't help but think of the group of women I saw Wonder Woman with; half of them left the theater in tears, the experience of watching a woman on screen was so viscerally moving.&nbsp;I think of the Mexican family seated next to me at a screening of Coco, who spent half the film sobbing audibly.</p><p>The only Asian men, let alone Chinese men, I saw on screen growing up were Mickey Rooney's bucktoothed caricature of a Japanese man in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Long Duck Dong in Sixteen Candles. If you've ever wondered why Bruce Lee is a near deity to Chinese men, it's simply that he was the only powerful representation of themselves they ever saw in American entertainment.</p><p>The archetype of almost every hero and leader I saw growing up was a white man, and it continues today, where the leadership team of almost every company in Silicon Valley is dominated by white men. Someone asked me once whether I could name a single Chinese CEO of a tech company who had been promoted into the role, rather than having founded the company. I couldn't think of one.</p><p>It's a blessing to me, then, that the age of infinite content has made culturally specific and truthful representation good business practice for Hollywood. I'd prefer we arrived by some more progressive route, but, as Russian writer Viktor Pelevin has noted, the chief protagonist of pop culture today is a briefcase of money. We've seen many a film with a whitewashed cast bomb recently, and it doesn't strike me as a coincidence. When we have an near infinite supply of content at our disposal, no one needs to settle for the bland, the milquetoast, the emotionally false.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>In that same post about the shifting dynamics of entertainment in the age of abundance, I wrote about the Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/houseofhighlights/\" target=\"_blank\">House of Highlights</a>. Fast Company cited it in an <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40519104/bleacher-reports-secret-weapon-is-a-23-year-old-instagram-savant\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> about House of Highlights.</p><p>The past week, I've been watching carefully to see which outlet picks up March Madness buzzer-beaters the quickest, and it is, more often than not, House of Highlights on which I see the first video replay.</p><p>Social networks go through several phases of evolution on their path to maturity. First, they need to get people to use it even when the graph is sparse. This is the single-player value problem. If they solve that, then the next efficient evolution is some sort of feed, usually populated by all content from people you follow. It's the easiest way to increase the surface area for each user, and it's the easiest way to amplify your service's network effects. The only way to increase a user's frequency of usage is to increase the volume of content to serve them, and aggregating content from all the people you follow is a simple way to personalize the feed, to create value for the lurkers who want to watch but not post, and to send addictive feedback signals to the creators of that content. It's the tried and true social network positive feedback loop.</p><p>Then, at some point, if the network is successful enough, the problem becomes one of too much content. This is typically when networks move from a chronological, exhaustive feed to an algorithmic feed on some relevance dimension. It's typically when some segment of early adopters complains about the loss of said chronological feed.</p><p>The algorithmic feed is social networks' counterpart to Inbox Zero. Social networks realized that an \"inbox zero\" solution to social network overload would never work; too few people would do the necessary work. Arguably, Inbox Zero has about the same adoption issue with regards to email.</p><p>GMail has a version of the algorithmic email inbox, it's the Important email box, and various other programs have tried to filter out unimportant emails from the inbox using a variety of strategies, but I'd be interested to see software go even a step further and prescribe more drastic measures for solving the signal-to-noise problem of that medium. If you're rich and powerful that solution is a stern administrative assistant but we've yet to scale that with AI. The closest I've come is my GMail's spam filter. I went in there recently and found a bunch of email I had actually subscribed to, but while the false positives were mildly annoying, I couldn't argue my life was harmed in any meaningful way. If you're waiting to hear from me, you're probably in my GMail spam folder, for some reason it's become increasingly aggressive.</p><p>Content services tend to try their own filtering solutions, tailored to their medium. Video streaming services use some mix of personalized and generic categorical recommendations to populate their interfaces, while news sites lean towards some matrix of chronology and importance overlaid with light categorization. Common to all of these is an acknowledgment that users don't tend to browse sideways through interfaces when exploring through the limited screen real estate of the smartphone screen, so maximizing relevance on a single infinitely scrolling interface window is the most profitable vector. Is it any surprise every video service seems to have autoplay turned on by default now?</p><p>This is all a roundabout way to say that House of Highlights will someday soon hit bump against the the limitations of the single news feed, despite all of that interface's advantages in aggregating eyeballs for content consumption and advertising on a smartphone screen. Like all providers, House of Highlights depends on the algorithm to push its content to people at the right time, and for those users to pull the content. I suspect that the next frontier for all these large and mature social networks is additional levels of in-feed structure.</p><p>We've already seen glimpses. The idea of stories, which made its first appearance in Instagram, solve the supply-side problem of social media. That is, in an exhaustive chronological feed, many users are shy about flooding the feed. This caps content supply.</p><p>Stories, by putting the onus on the viewer to pull the story, unlocks a flood of content. Post frequently, guilt-free! I'd guess that the demand on that content is limited, but paired with the regular algorithmic or chronological feed, you essentially create two marketplaces of content in one interface.</p><p>Instagram now allows multiple photos per post, another example of added structure. But for now, the algorithms largely restrict themselves to either choosing to display a piece of content or not. It's all candidate selection.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect the next breakthrough for all our most used mobile apps, all of whom have achieved massive scale, from Facebook to Instagram to Twitter to YouTube to Snapchat and so on, will be an evolution of the algorithm beyond pure content selection, and an evolution of the presentation of said content from into a broader array of templates.</p><p>It's a topic for another post.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>Justin Fox of Bloomberg posted a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-15/think-march-madness-is-boring-watch-more-than-the-highlights\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> related to my post and its discussion of brittle narratives. He notes that some folks have tried to address the problem of brittle narratives when it comes to sports. As an example, he links a video from Ben Falk's <a href=\"https://cleaningtheglass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cleaning the Glass</a>, a popular new subscription service for basketball junkies from a former NBA front office staffer.</p><p>Writes Fox:</p><blockquote>As with my experience in reading about and then watching UVA's Pack Line, it is also a reminder that there are narratives to sports events that go deeper than what can be plausibly condensed into standard highlight reels,&nbsp;and that casual viewers can be taught to appreciate them. I really am not much of a basketball fan, but Falk's explainer makes me want to observe James in action over extended periods to see if I can detect other such episodes of quiet brilliance. I probably won't; I've got way too many other things going on to add regular watching of the Cleveland Cavaliers to my schedule. But I am at least <em>thinking</em>&nbsp;about it.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>In soccer, the sport I watch most on TV except in years when the Oakland A's are good, the highlight moments are so rare that you really can't appreciate the games unless you have some understanding (mine is admittedly pretty rudimentary and inarticulate) of the dramas playing out on the field between the scores and near-misses. In other sports, there have always been a few announcers who capably weave these background narratives into their work. I know Tim McCarver was driving most viewers crazy by the time he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/26/tim-mccarver-world-series-2013\" target=\"_blank\">retired from calling baseball games in 2013</a>, but I can remember him adding layer after layer to the game-watching experience in earlier years.

All the sports leagues have to deal with an onboarding problem with their televised content, and that is the learning curve of appreciation. If you haven't grown up watching and/or playing a sport, it's difficult to appreciate a lot of the moment to moment skill on display in any sporting event.</p><p>I did not grow up playing soccer, so I find so much of it boring to watch outside of the occasional spectacular goal. The ability of a team to keep possession, the skill of a single player like Messi to evade a gauntlet of defenders, so much of that skill is lost on me. The same goes for hockey, or cricket, or so many sports I didn't grow up with.</p><p>On the other hand, while many find baseball unbelievably boring, I played growing up, and so even a pitch that isn't swung is seen, by me, as one in a fascinating game theory exchange between pitcher and batter. One of the most exciting plays of the 2016 World Series to me was when Kyle Schwarber laid off a tantalizing slider from Andrew Miller because I knew what a great pitch it was and how much skill it took to not offer at it. For most viewers, it was just another ball, another twenty seconds of inconsequential activity.</p><p>The Olympics face this problem in spades because they include so many niche sports, but luckily for them, many of the events are short in nature, and the nature of the contest easily explained. When it isn't, the networks lean heavily on personal narrative, something that almost all viewers understand. We can debate until eternity whether Alina Zagitova or Evgenia Medvedeva deserved the gold medal in the women's figure skating final, but it didn't take an expert on figure skating to feel the tension backstage as each skater tried to get in each other's heads.</p><p>More forward-thinking sports leagues should consider, in the future, making it easier for analysts of all sorts to provide alternative broadcast commentary for their broadcasts. I'd be shocked if it didn't happen in my lifetime. Viewing your sports as broadcast platform with API's allowing for such diversity of integrated analysis would broaden the appeal to different audiences. As it is, some audiences cobble together such alternate peanut gallery chatter from Twitter, Periscope, Facebook, and other social media. I predict leagues will start integrating this content; it makes much more sense than Twitter licensing those video rights to try to facilitate such water coolers. The water cooler is heavy, it's plugged into the wall, and it's expensive; easier to go walk over there to chat than to try to carry the water cooler over to the discussion.</p><p>Exceeding this learning curve of appreciation isn't sufficient, however. Beyond that, there still exists the problem of rendering your content more culturally relevant, at this moment, than anything else on a person's phone. Anyone who's sat across from someone, only to see that their companion turn their attention to a smartphone, understands this modern conundrum.</p><p>This isn't just a problem for sports. In an age where Netflix is producing some 700 original series next year, not to mention all the ones from HBO and Amazon and Hulu and FX and on and on, every content provider has to become more thoughtful and creative about how to manufacture desire on the part of the viewer. The temptation, in tech, is to use some recommendations and machine learning to pick content to present to any one viewer, but that is going to be wholly insufficient.</p><p>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, they say. When what you possess is lots of software engineers gifted at crunching large data sets, everything can look like an ML problem. That leaves huge swaths of human psychology on the table. There are still so many opportunities for so many services to render their content more relevant to a larger audience, a scary proposition to those who already find so many of their apps addictive.</p><p>Again, different categories of content tend to resort to the same narrow band of strategies as their competitors, but when we live in an age where almost all content across all mediums act as substitute goods for each other, companies and creatives should be widening their net to learn from outside their category. The competition won't wrestle on your terms, the battle is asymmetric.</p><p>A full list of such strategies is a topic for another day, but I'd argue every company should be looking at everything from House of Highlights to infomercials to Buzzfeed to Disneyland theme parks to high fashion to Costco to Beyonce and Rihanna to the fine art world to YouTube vloggers like Logan Paul to the design of Fortnite to just about everything about Las Vegas to pop-up restaurants to limited edition sneaker drops to folks like Tyler Cowen and Ben Thompson.</p><p>If we, as consumers, are fighting to resist the Siren song, then on the flip side is a pitched battle to spin the Siren song that will rise above the din.</p><blockquote>Now stop your ship and listen to our voices.<br />All those who pass this way hear honeyed song,<br />poured from our mouths.</blockquote>~\n",

Now, this is, to my mind, where the story begins to reveal its deeper truths. In the books we learn that Saruman was spying on Gandalf for years. And he wondered why Gandalf was traveling so incessantly to the Shire. As Tolkien later establishes, the Shire’s surfeit of pipe-weed is one of the major reasons for Gandalf’s continued visits.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>ZINN: You view the conflict as being primarily about pipe-weed, do you not?<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>CHOMSKY: Well, what we see here, in Hobbiton, farmers tilling crops. The thing to remember is that the crop they are tilling is, in fact, pipe-weed, an addictive drug transported and sold throughout Middle Earth for great profit.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>ZINN: This is absolutely established in the books. Pipe-weed is something all the Hobbits abuse. Gandalf is smoking it constantly. You are correct when you point out that Middle Earth depends on pipe-weed in some crucial sense, but I think you may be overstating its importance. Clearly the war is not based only on the Shire’s pipe-weed. Rohan and Gondor’s unceasing hunger for war is a larger culprit, I would say.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>CHOMSKY: But without the pipe-weed, Middle Earth would fall apart. Saruman is trying to break up Gandalf’s pipe-weed ring. He’s trying to divert it.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>ZINN: Well, you know, it would be manifestly difficult to believe in magic rings unless everyone was high on pipe-weed. So it is in Gandalf’s interest to keep Middle Earth hooked.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>CHOMSKY: How do you think these wizards build gigantic towers and mighty fortresses? Where do they get the money? Keep in mind that I do not especially regard anyone, Saruman included, as an agent for progressivism. But obviously the pipe-weed operation that exists is the dominant influence in Middle Earth. It’s not some ludicrous magical ring.<br /> </blockquote><p>A bit more, because I can't help myself:</p><blockquote>ZINN: Right. And here we receive our first glimpse of the supposedly dreadful Mordor, which actually looks like a fairly functioning place.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>CHOMSKY: This type of city is most likely the best the Orcs can do if all they have are cliffs to grow on. It’s very impressive, in that sense.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>ZINN: Especially considering the economic sanctions no doubt faced by Mordor. They must be dreadful. We see now that the Black Riders have been released, and they’re going after Frodo. The <em>Black Riders</em>. Of course they’re black. Everything evil is always black. And later Gandalf the Grey becomes Gandalf the White. Have you noticed that?<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>CHOMSKY: The most simplistic color symbolism.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>ZINN: And the writing on the ring, we learn here, is Orcish — the so-called “black speech.” Orcish is evidently some spoliation of the language spoken in Rohan. This is what Tolkien says.<br /> </blockquote><p>Somewhat related is this, <a href=\"https://themorningnews.org/article/the-passion-of-the-christ-blooper-reel\" target=\"_blank\">The Passion of the Christ: Blooper Reel</a>.</p><blockquote><em>Christ, shackled to a stone, is being scourged by Roman soldiers.

      "<blockquote>It is hard for us humans to separate information from meaning because we cannot help interpreting messages. We infuse messages with meaning automatically, fooling ourselves to believe that the meaning of a message is carried in the message. But it is not. This is only an illusion. Meaning is derived from context and prior knowledge. Meaning is the interpretation that a knowledge agent, such as a human, gives to a message, but it is different from the physical order that carries the message, and different from the message itself. Meaning emerges when a message reaches a life-form or a machine with the ability to process information; it is not carried in the blots of ink, sound waves, beams of light, or electric pulses that transmit information.<br /> </blockquote><p>From the book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2qnvCBx\" target=\"_blank\">Why Information Grows</a> by Cesar Hidalgo. I read this book a long ways back in 2017,&nbsp; but it's of no less interest now.</p><blockquote>And it is the arrow of complexity—the growth of information—that marks the history of our universe and species. Billions of years ago, soon after the Big Bang, our universe did not have the capacity to generate the order that made Boltzmann marvel and which we all take for granted. Since then, our universe has been marching toward disorder, as Boltzmann predicted, but it has also been busy producing pockets that concentrate enormous quantities of physical order, or information. Our planet is a chief example of such a pocket.<br /> </blockquote><p>When one first encounters the second law of thermodynamics, it's easy to tumble into despair at the pointlessness of everything. With the universe fated to collapse into heat death eventually, what is the point of it all?</p><p>In this existential void,&nbsp;the presence of pockets of information and order can feel like symbols of rebellion, a raised fist spray painted on a fragment of wall that remains from a bombed-out building. In manifestations of order we see intent, in intent we interpret meaning, and in meaning we find comfort.</p><blockquote>Information, when understood in its broad meaning as physical order, is what our economy produces. It is the only thing we produce, whether we are biological cells or manufacturing plants. This is because information is not restricted to messages. It is inherent in all the physical objects we produce: bicycles, buildings, streetlamps, blenders, hair dryers, shoes, chandeliers, harvesting machines, and underwear are all made of information. This is not because they are made of ideas but because they embody physical order. Our world is pregnant with information. It is not an amorphous soup of atoms, but a neatly organized collection of structures, shapes, colors, and correlations. Such ordered structures are the manifestations of information, even when these chunks of physical order lack any meaning.<br /> </blockquote><p>There are plenty of books on information theory, and viewing the universe through the lens of information and computation is increasingly popular, but Hidalgo's book is more readable than most.</p><blockquote>To battle disorder and allow information to grow, our universe has a few tricks up its sleeve. These tricks involve out-of-equilibrium systems, the accumulation of information in solids, and the ability of matter to compute.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>It is the growth of information that unifies the emergence of life with the growth of economies, and the emergence of complexity with the origins of wealth.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>In twenty-six minutes Iris traveled from the ancientness of her mother’s womb to the modernity of twenty-first-century society. Birth is, in essence, time travel.<br /> </blockquote><p>Birth as time travel is one of those metaphors that, once heard, lodges in your mind like something you always knew. When Arnold Schwarzenegger time travels back from the future to the modern day in <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2DzKNi0\" target=\"_blank\">The Terminator</a>, he arrives naked, like a newborn.</p><p>[It is unclear why a cyborg from the future speaks with a thick Austrian accent, one of the only mysteries I have always hoped would be explained in some throwaway expository joke. My guess is that the voice was a marketing Easter Egg, like celebrity voices in Waze, and someone forgot to flip the Terminator back to its factory default voice before sending it back in time.]</p><blockquote>Humans are special animals when it comes to information, because unlike other species, we have developed an enormous ability to encode large volumes of information outside our bodies. Naively, we can think of this information as the information we encode in books, sheet music, audio recordings, and video. Yet for longer than we have been able to write we have been embodying information in artifacts or objects, from arrows to microwave ovens, from stone axes to the physical Internet. So our ability to produce chairs, computers, tablecloths, and wineglasses is a simple answer to the eternal question: what is the difference between us, humans, and all other species? The answer is that we are able to create physical instantiations of the objects we imagine, while other species are stuck with nature’s inventory.<br /> </blockquote><p>Another reason humans wouldn't evolve on a gaseous planet like Jupiter, besides the fact that we'd just burn up, is that without any solids we'd have no way of encoding information to pass on to future generations. Therefore, any advanced civilization in the universe would, it would seem, live in physical conditions that allow for the formation of solids, but not solids that are too rigid.</p><p>The temperature band matters. We need solids that are malleable to encode richer sets of information. Add to that the ability to compute, which we see in all forms in our world, down to the cellular level, and suddenly you have life. There is logic to why we look for specific conditions in the universe as precursors for life, and it can be defined more broadly than just looking for water, which is a downstream condition. Further upstream we just want a planet with solids, in a particular band of temperatures.</p><p>Such conditions allow living creatures to record and pass along information to the next generation. When humans finally were able to do so, they in effect conquered time. No longer did the knowledge of one generation evaporate into the sinkhole of mortality.</p><blockquote>The car’s dollar value evaporated in the crash not because the crash destroyed the atoms that made up the Bugatti but because the crash changed the way in which these were arranged. As the parts that made the Bugatti were pulled apart and twisted, the information that was embodied in the Bugatti was largely destroyed. This is another way of saying that the $2.5 million worth of value was stored not in the car’s atoms but in the way those atoms were arranged.&nbsp;That arrangement is information.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>...<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>So the value of the Bugatti is connected to physical order, which is information, even though people still debate what information is.&nbsp;According to Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, information is a measure of the minimum volume of communication required to uniquely specify a message. That is, it’s the number of bits we need to communicate an arrangement, like the arrangement of atoms that made the Bugatti.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>...<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The group of Bugattis in perfect shape, however, is relatively small, meaning that in the set of all possible rearrangement of atoms—like people moving in a stadium—very few of these involve a Bugatti in perfect condition. The group of Bugatti wrecks, on the other hand, is a configuration with a higher multiplicity of states (higher entropy), and hence a configuration that embodies less information (even though each of these states requires more bits to be communicated). Yet the largest group of all, the one that is equivalent to people sitting randomly in the stadium, is the one describing Bugattis in their “natural” state. This is the state where iron is a mineral ore and aluminum is embedded in bauxite. The destruction of the Bugatti, therefore, is the destruction of information. The creation of the Bugatti, on the other hand, is the embodiment of information.<br /> </blockquote><p>One can separate out the intrinsic value of an item, defined above as the rarity of the state of the configuration of that item, from the external value of an item, as defined by qualities such as symbolic or emotional ones, like nostalgia.</p><p>In <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, Bruce Willis risks life and limb to recover a watch given to him by his father. There's no evidence it's a particularly rare watch, he could likely buy another just like it,&nbsp;but its symbolic value to him is extrinsic to the item yet tethered to it the way a genie is trapped in a magic lantern (and that special meaning is conveyed in the now immortal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFtHjV4c4uw\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a> by Christopher Walken).</p><p>Even the most rational people I know own something that's not physically rare but emotionally rich, a talisman or totem that they use to summon whatever power it holds, whether it be nostalgia or regret or some other enchantment known only to themselves.</p><blockquote>What Shannon teaches us is that the amount of information that is embodied in a tweet is equal to the minimum number of yes-or-no questions that Brian needs to ask to guess Abby’s tweet with 100 percent accuracy.&nbsp;But how many questions is that?<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Shannon’s theory tells us that we need 700 bits, or yes-or-no questions, to communicate a tweet written using a thirty-two-character alphabet. Shannon’s theory is also the basis of modern communication systems.<br /> </blockquote><p>One mathematical reason for the rising usage of emoji in Twitter and other forms of online communication may be that it increases the amount of information that can be encoded in 140 (and now 280) characters.</p><p>You'll recall from earlier that the third of the three conditions that allow information to grow is the ability of matter to compute.</p><blockquote>To illustrate the prebiotic nature of the ability of matter to process information, we need to consider a more fundamental system. Here is where the chemical systems that fascinated Prigogine come in handy. Consider a set of chemical reactions that takes a set of compounds {I} and transforms them into a set of outputs {O} via a set of intermediate compounds {M}. Now consider feeding this system with a steady flow of {I}. If the flow of {I} is small, then the system will settle into a steady state where the intermediate inputs {M} will be produced and consumed in such a way that their numbers do not fluctuate much. The system will reach a state of equilibrium. In most chemical systems, however, once we crank up the flow of {I} this equilibrium will become unstable, meaning that the steady state of the system will be replaced by two or more stable steady states that are different from the original state of equilibrium.13 When these new steady states emerge, the system will need to “choose” among them, meaning that it will have to move to one or the other, breaking the symmetry of the system and developing a history that is marked by those choices. If we crank up the inflow of the input compounds {I} even further, these new steady states will become unstable and additional new steady states will emerge. This multiplication of steady states can lead these chemical reactions to highly organized states, such as those exhibited by molecular clocks, which are chemical oscillators, compounds that change periodically from one type to another. But does such a simple chemical system have the ability to process information? Now consider that we can push the system to one of these steady states by changing the concentration of inputs {I}. Such a system will be “computing,” since it will be generating outputs that are conditional on the inputs it is ingesting. It would be a chemical transistor. In an awfully crude way this chemical system models a primitive metabolism. In an even cruder way, it is a model of a cell differentiating from one cell type to another—the cell types can be viewed abstractly as the dynamic steady states of these systems, as the complex systems biologist Stuart Kauffman suggested decades ago.&nbsp;Highly interacting out-of-equilibrium systems, whether they are trees reacting to the change of seasons or chemical systems processing information about the inputs they receive, teach us that matter can compute. These systems tell us that computation precedes the origins of life just as much as information does. The chemical changes encoded by these systems are modifying the information encoded in these chemical compounds, and therefore they represent a fundamental form of computation. Life is a consequence of the ability of matter to compute.<br /> </blockquote><p>What's lovely about all of these conditions that allow information to grow is their seeming relevance to individuals and groups of individuals, like corporations or societies or markets.</p><p>Humans are concentrated bundles of information with compute power, and when we push ourselves out of equilibrium, we accumulate information. When we crank up our inputs and force ourselves out of our own equilibrium, as we do when we become students, we grow as we restore ourselves to steady state. Whenever anyone complains that they're in a rut, I always counsel them to force themselves out of equilibrium.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>That covers much of the first half of the book, all fascinating. However, the part of the book that's of broader interest to a business audience is Hidalgo's discussion of the economy as a creator of information.</p><p>It's easiest to understand the information creation capacity of an economy by examining its outputs, and the simplest outputs to understand are physical products.</p><blockquote>Thinking about products as crystals of imagination tells us that products do not just embody information but also imagination. This is information that we have generated through mental computations and then disembodied by creating an object that mimics the one we had in our head. Edible apples existed before we had a name for them, a price for them, or a market for them. They were present in the world. As a concept, apples were simply imported into our minds. On the other hand, iPhones and iPads are mental exports rather than imports, since they are products that were begotten in our minds before they became part of our world. So the main difference between apples and Apples resides in the source of their physical order rather than in their embodiment of physical order. Both products are packets of information, but only one of them is a crystal of imagination.<br /> </blockquote><p>Like many navel gazers in the tech industry, I'm guilty of stereotyping companies. Apple's strength is integrated hardware and software, Google is the king of machine learning and crunching large data sets, Facebook is the social network to end all social networks, and Amazon is the everything platform.</p><p>However, if you haven't worked or been inside any of those companies, it's fairest to judge them as black boxes into which inputs disappear and come out as various outputs, usually products and services like gadgets or websites or applications. Everything else is a mild form of fan fiction.&nbsp;</p><p>By analyzing a company's outputs, one can deduce a great deal about its capabilities. Hidalgo does the same but at the country level.</p><blockquote>The idea of crystallized imagination tells us that a country’s export structure carries information about more than just its abundance of capital and labor. A country’s export structure is a fingerprint that tells us about the ability of people in that country to create tangible instantiations of imaginary objects, such as automobiles, espresso machines, subway cars, and motorcycles, and of course about the myriad of specific factors that are needed to create these sophisticated products. In fact, the composition of a country’s exports informs us about the knowledge and knowhow that are embodied in that country’s population.<br /> </blockquote><p>A country that can export a product like an iPhone generally has greater generative power than one that can only export raw materials like bananas. The telltale clues to the economic potential of a country lie not in its imports but its exports.</p><blockquote>So what has any of this to do with Chile? The only connection between Chile and the history of electricity comes from the fact that the Atacama Desert is full of copper atoms, which, just like most Chileans, were utterly unaware of the electric dreams that powered the passion of Faraday and Tesla. As the inventions that made these atoms valuable were created, Chile retained the right to hold many of these atoms hostage. Now Chile can make a living out of them. This brings us back to the narrative of exploitation we described earlier. The idea of crystallized imagination should make it clear that Chile is the one exploiting the imagination of Faraday, Tesla, and others, since it was the inventors’ imagination that endowed copper atoms with economic value. But Chile is not the only country that exploits foreign creativity this way. Oil producers like Venezuela and Russia exploit the imagination of Henry Ford, Rudolf Diesel, Gottlieb Daimler, Nicolas Carnot, James Watt, and James Joule by being involved in the commerce of a dark gelatinous goo that was virtually useless until combustion engines were invented.&nbsp;Making a strong distinction between the generation of value and the appropriation of monetary compensation helps us understand the difference between wealth and economic development. In fact, the world has many countries that are rich but still have underdeveloped economies. This is a distinction that we will explore in detail in Part IV. But making this distinction, which comes directly from the idea of crystallized imagination, helps us see that economic development is based not on the ability of a pocket of the economy to consume but on the ability of people to turn their dreams into reality. Economic development is not the ability to buy but the ability to make.<br /> </blockquote><p>At a corporate level, I can recall an age when Sony was the king of consumer electronics the world over. I first coveted a Walkman, then later a Discman. Our family spent its formative years huddled around a giant (at the time) Sony Trinitron TV, and we were the envy of all my friends for owning one. I looked forward to any trip to Japan for a chance to walk the electronics districts to purchase the coolest gadgets on the planet, and for years I owned a Minidisc player model that you couldn't find in the U.S.</p><p>And then the world shifted, and the gadget which subsumed all other gadgets was the computer, and as it shrank in size while growing in computational power, the way we interacted with such devices increasingly became software-based. In that competition,&nbsp;the vector which mattered more than anything became software design, a skill Sony had not mastered.</p><p>The company that understood both software and hardware design better than any company in the world happened to be located in Silicon Valley, not Japan, and, after a long Wintel interregnum, caused by a number of business factors covered comprehensively elsewhere, Apple's unique skills found themselves in a universe they could really dent. And dent they did.</p><p>Thanks especially to the market opportunity created by the smartphone, which it seized with the iPhone, Apple not only surpassed Sony and moved the balance of power in consumer technology across the Pacific Ocean to American shores but became <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/08/apple-800-billion-market-cap/\" target=\"_blank\">the most valuable company in the entire world</a>.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>Not all information is easily embodied. For example, for a while I puzzled over what I'll call the Din Tai Fung Paradox.</p><p><a href=\"http://dintaifungusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Din Tai Fung</a> is a restaurant chain, and I visited the original outlet in Taipei decades ago with my mother. They're known for their Shanghainese soup dumplings, made with a very delicate wrap that somehow never breaks and dumps its precious cargo of pork broth until the moment at which you prod it with your chopsticks just so. Some will argue whether Ding Tai Fung is all that and a bucket of chicken, but at a minimum I find the menu to be satisfying comfort food done consistently, in a setting that is usually cleaner and more well-kept than your average chain restaurant outlet. You'll find superior deals from a street vendor and more elaborate preparation at a higher-end restaurant, but Din Tai Fung industrializes and scales a Chinese staple. We don't pay enough attention to scale.</p><p>The mystery is why Din Tai Fung has opened so few outlets; they've only dropped locations in a handful of cities in about ten countries in the world, and every Din Tai Fung is packed solid from open to close with the type of ever-present line of humans snaked outside the front door that you so rarely see at any restaurant, let alone a chain.</p><p>For a few months, a new outlet was rumored to be opening in San Francisco soon, and among my friends it was as momentous a rumor as if a new Star Wars teaser trailer had dropped. Ultimately, one opened in the Bay Area, but in Santa Clara instead of San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><p>Which leads to a further mystery: why haven't any competing chains opened up to make the same items to fill the market void? I would never open a restaurant, but my family knows I'd make an exception if I were granted the opportunity to open a branch of Din Tai Fung anywhere.&nbsp;I bring it up every family gathering, when there's a lull in the conversation. Forget cryptocurrency, I want to mint me some Din Tai Fung coin.</p><p>At every Din Tai Fung I've been to, they have a glass window so you can look into the kitchen to see the soup dumplings being wrapped, always by kitchen staff wearing white uniforms, almost like lab assistants, an impression magnified by the branches that require face masks. It's rumored that the branches in Asia try to hire the tallest, most attractive men to man the soup dumpling assembly line, but it sounds about as true as a lot of things my aunts and uncles tell me, which is to say it's more credible than I'd care to admit.</p><p>The hermetic vibe behind the glass is as far from the vendor selling goods from a street cart as possible; some find street food charming but if you're taking this food to a global audience it needs to be sanitized or sterilized, the same way movies for the Chinese market strip out any storylines that might offend. It's not just the front of the house that's immaculate, the show behind the glass display says they have nothing to hide. It's the equivalent of the blackjack dealer at a casino clapping and turning their hands one way and the other before moving to the next table.</p><p>More interesting to me was that Din Tai Fung even doesn't even bother to hide the process behind its staple dish, the evidence is on thousands of smart phones by this point, everyone seems to stop to take a photo or video of the assembly line while waiting for their table.</p><p>And yet any Chinese food fan knows it's notoriously hard to find a good soup dumpling. In this age where recipes for almost anything are available online for free, why can't you find a good soup dumpling in most major cities in the world? Or, for that matter, a good burrito, or any dish you love? Why are these crystals of imagination so unevenly distributed when the recipes for making them so broadly available?</p><p>The answer, as any home chef who has tried to make a dish from some highfalutin cookbook knows, is simple: you can have the most precise ingredient list and directions and still struggle to make anything approaching what you ate, whether it came from a $400 tasting menu or a mainstream cookbook. Cooking is not nearly as deterministic as the term recipe implies.</p><p>Slight variations in environment, weather, ingredients, and cookware can lead to massive differences in the final product. Your oven may say 400 degrees, but the actual temperature inside, at the precise spot where you've placed your baking dish, may be different. That celery you use for your mirepoix today may not be as fresh as the celery you used last week. The air pressure where you're cooking on a particular day may differ from that where you live, the bacteria in the air may also vary. Great chefs appear on Top Chef and flail making dishes they've made hundreds of times in their own restaurant kitchen because every bit of environmental variation matters.</p><p>We may glamorize the image of the genius, heroic chef, working magic to create a delicious and beautifully plated dish that a waiter places before us with a balletic flourish, but the true value creation in a restaurant comes from translating that moment of genius into a rote, repeatable cycle.&nbsp;The popularity of sous vide as a cooking technique, even at high end restaurants, comes down its repeatable precision and accuracy. Ask any chef and they'll tell you the value of a line chef who can cook dozens of proteins to the right level of doneness every time given the high cost of fish and meat.</p><p>In addition to all those conditionals, much of cooking skill comes down to learned muscle memory and pattern recognition that can only be encoded in a human being through repeated trial and error. I tried to learn some of my favorite of my mother and grandmother's dishes by writing down recipes they dictated to me, but much was lost in translation. Like so much maternal magic, it could only be learned, truly, at their side, with an apron on, watching, imitating, botching one dish after another, until some of it seeped into my bones.</p><p>In a memorable <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFP5xD2l3ro\" target=\"_blank\">segment</a> from the documentary <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2D92Ivo\" target=\"_blank\">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>, apprentice Daisuke Nakazawa is assigned the job of making egg sushi, or tamago. He believes it will be simple, but again and again, Jiro rejects his work. Nakazawa ends up making over 200 rejected samples until finally, one day, Jiro approves. Nakazawa cries in relief and joy.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>Hardware and software are not like cooking. When knowledge and instructions can be encoded in bits, a level of precision is possible that is effectively, for the purposes of this discussion,&nbsp;deterministic. Manufacturing a hundred million iPhones is like food production, but not the type done in high end or home kitchens. Instead, it is more like producing a hundred million Oreos.</p><p>There is one country in the world where that many iPhones can be manufactured for the cost that allows Apple to reap its insane profits: China. I can't think of any other country in the world, not India or Mexico or the United States, or all of Europe together that can make that many iPhones for that price to meet the market demand year after year. Some countries have the labor but not the skills, others have the skills but not enough labor, and others just can't do the work as cheaply as China can.</p><p>Recall that the potential of an economy can be judged by the complexity of its exports. Based on that, it's difficult to imagine an economy outside of the U.S. with more potential than China. Some of the most complex products in the world, and the iPhone deserves to be on that list, are made in China.</p><p>I've backed many a Kickstarter hardware project, and without fail, every one has been made in China, usually Shenzhen. Inevitably, when the products are delayed, the project's creators will send an update with some photos of a few of them in China, at some plant, examining some part that will get the project back on track, or with their arms around a few Chinese plant managers giving a thumbs up sign.</p><p>Kickstarter often feels like an industrial and software design and marketing operation layer grafted on top of the manufacturing capabilities of Shenzhen. It is an early warning indicator of China's economic potential, and the gap that remains to realizing it.</p><p>Here is another. Foxconn assembles iPhones for Apple, and for their efforts they make anywhere from $8 to $30 per iPhone, depending on what article you believe. Whatever the figure, we know it is not far off from that.</p><p>Apple, in contrast, makes hundreds of dollars per iPhone. They earn that premium, many multiples what Foxconn earns, by virtue of being the ones who designed every aspect of the phone, from the software to the hardware. China can supply labor and even sometimes components, but the crystal of imagination that is the iPhone, perhaps the most valuable such crystal in the history of the world, comes almost entirely from the imagination of employees of Apple. Foxconn is one cog in a long supply chain, and that link isn't the one made of gold.</p><p>However, to even have the capability of making an iPhone for less than the cost of a lunch in San Francisco is a skill, one China has shown again and again. Many another country wishes it had such a demonstrated skill. Were China ever able to gain some of the software and industrial design skills of a company like Apple, they would be even more of an economic powerhouse than they are now.</p><p>That's a massive conditional. It's not something that can be learned by mere handwaving or even sheer industriousness. After all, Sony could return to its former glory, or Samsung be even more dominant globally, if software design skills were so easily learned.</p><p>Someone someday will write a book of the history of software design and how it came to be that Apple built up that capability more than any other technology company, and I'll be among its most eager readers because it's an untold story that holds the key to one of the greatest value creation stories in the history of business.</p><blockquote>...our world is one in which knowledge and knowhow are “heavier” than the atoms we use to embody their practical uses. Information can be moved around easily in the products that contain it, whether these are objects, books, or webpages, but knowledge and knowhow are trapped in the bodies of people and the networks that these people form. Knowledge and knowhow are so “heavy” that when it comes to a simple product such as a cellphone battery, it is infinitely easier to bring the lithium atoms that lie dormant in the Atacama Desert to Korea than to bring the knowledge of lithium batteries that resides in Korean scientists to the bodies of the miners who populate the Atacaman cities of Antofagasta and Calama. Our world is marked by great international differences in countries’ ability to crystallize imagination. These differences emerge because countries differ in the knowledge and knowhow that are embodied in their populations, and because accumulating knowledge and knowhow in people is difficult. But why is it hard for us to accumulate the knowledge and knowhow we need to transform our dreams into reality?<br /> </blockquote><p>If knowledge were so easy to transfer, I'd be a three-star Michelin Chef because someone gifted me a copy of the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2m975Q2\" target=\"_blank\">Eleven Madison Park cookbook</a>.</p><blockquote>Getting knowledge inside a human’s nervous system is not easy because learning is both experiential and social.5 To say that learning is social means that people learn from people: children learn from their parents and employees learn from their coworkers (I hope). The social nature of learning makes the accumulation of knowledge and knowhow geographically biased. People learn from people, and it is easier for people to learn from others who are experienced in the tasks they want to learn than from people with no relevant experience in that task. For instance, it is difficult to become an air traffic controller without learning the trade from other air traffic controllers, just as it is difficult to become a surgeon without having ever been an intern or a resident at a hospital. By the same token, it is hard to accumulate the knowhow needed to manufacture rubber tires or an electric circuit without interacting with people who have made tires or circuits.6 Ultimately, the experiential and social nature of learning not only limits the knowledge and knowhow that individuals can achieve but also biases the accumulation of knowledge and knowhow toward what is already available in the places where these individuals reside. This implies that the accumulation of knowledge and knowhow is geographically biased.<br /> </blockquote><p>What governs the information production capacity of a country?&nbsp;Hidalgo coins two terms to analyze this problem. One is the personbyte.</p><blockquote>We can simplify this discussion by defining the maximum amount of knowledge and knowhow that a human nervous system can accumulate as a fundamental unit of measurement. We call this unit a personbyte, and define it as the maximum knowledge and knowhow carrying capacity of a human.<br /> </blockquote><p>The other term is firmbyte.</p><blockquote>The limited proliferation of megafactories like the Rouge implies that there must be mechanisms that limit the size of the networks we call firms and make it preferable to disaggregate production into networks of firms. This also suggests the existence of a second quantization limit, which we will call the firmbyte. It is analogous to the personbyte, but instead of requiring the distribution of knowledge and knowhow among people, it requires them to be distributed among a network of firms.<br /> </blockquote><p>Hidalgo then delves a bit into Coase's <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2CSAwjC\" target=\"_blank\">transaction cost theory of the firm</a>. Traditionally, Coase's theory is used as a way to explain why firms are fundamentally limited in their size, the idea being that at some size, external transactions become cheaper than internal coordination costs and so it's more efficient to just transact externally rather than produce internally.</p><p>I'm not interested in examining that topic now. Instead, let's assume that firms all do have some asymptote in size beyond which Coase's anchor becomes too heavy. The interesting implication is that given the existence of a ceiling on the size of the firmbyte, if some chunk of knowledge exceeds that capacity then it can only be carried by a network of firms.</p><p>It's long been said that the center of the technology universe shifted from Boston's route 128 to Silicon Valley because California banned non-competes (<a href=\"http://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/publication/256234/doc/slspublic/NYULawReview-74-3-Gilson.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here's one study</a>). Hidalgo's theory of the finite compute ability of a network of humans and firms explains how this works. The free movement of employees in Silicon Valley allows the region's knowledge-carrying capacity to increase at the expense of any single firm's benefit. Per Coase, the cost of information movement in Silicon Valley, as embodied by an employee carrying a personbyte from one firm to the next, is lower than it was in the route 128 corridor.</p><p>Let's telescope back out to the country level. What applies at the regional or industry level holds at the country level. A country's knowledge carrying capacity, and thus its information production power, is influenced in part by the size of networks it can form.</p><blockquote>In his 1995 book Trust, he [Francis Fukuyama] argues that the ability of a society to form large networks is largely a reflection of that society’s level of trust. Fukuyama makes a strong distinction between what he calls “familial” societies, like those of southern Europe and Latin America, and “high-trust” societies, like those of Germany, the United States, and Japan.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Familial societies are societies where people don’t trust strangers but do trust deeply the individuals in their own families (the Italian Mafia being a cartoon example of a familial society). In familial societies family networks are the dominant form of social organization where economic activity is embedded, and are therefore societies where businesses are more likely to be ventures among relatives. By contrast, in high-trust societies people don’t have a strong preference for trusting their kin and are more likely to develop firms that are professionally run. Familial societies and high-trust societies differ not only in the composition of the networks they form—as in kin and non-kin—but also in the size of the networks they can form. This is because the professionally run businesses that evolve in high-trust societies are more likely to result in networks of all sizes, including large ones. In contrast, familial societies are characterized by a large number of small businesses and a few dominant families controlling a few large conglomerates.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Yet, as we have argued before, the size of networks matters, since it helps determine the economic activities that take place in a location. Larger networks are needed to produce products of higher complexity and, in turn, for societies to achieve higher levels of prosperity. So according to Fukuyama, the presence of industries of different sizes indicates the presence of trust. In his own words: “Industrial structure tells an intriguing story about a country’s culture. Societies that have very strong families but relatively weak bonds of trust among people unrelated to one another will tend to be dominated by small, family-owned and managed business. On the other hand, countries that have vigorous private nonprofit organizations like schools, hospitals, churches, and charities, are also likely to develop strong private economic institutions that go beyond the family.”<br /> </blockquote><p>In <a href=\"https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/watch-a-conversation-with-luigi-zingales-c5ed3601a8f0#.wu2zvh2gz\" target=\"_blank\">Tyler Cowen's conversation with economist Luigi Zingales</a>, the latter hints at the limitations of familial economies in humorous fashion:</p><blockquote>One friend of mine was saying that the demise of the Italian firm family structure is the demise of the Italian family. In essence, when you used to have seven kids, one out of seven in the family was smart. You could find him. You could transfer the business within the family with a little bit of meritocracy and selection.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>When you’re down to one or two kids, the chance that one is an idiot is pretty large. The result is that you can’t really transfer the business within the family. The biggest problem of Italy is actually fertility, in my view, because we don’t have enough kids. If you don’t have enough kids, you don’t have enough people to transfer. You don’t have enough young people to be dynamic.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>The Italian culture has a lot of defects, but the entrepreneurship culture was there, has been there, and it still is there, but we don’t have enough young people.<br /> </blockquote><p>Low fertility's impact on economies is an issue globally, for example <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japan-succession-crisis-could-rip-links-out-of-auto-supply-chain\" target=\"_blank\">in Japan</a>, but low trust outside of family is an even broader constraint on the knowledge carrying capacity of an economy. If you can't form as large a firm as another country, you can't compete in some businesses and the information producing capability of your economy has a lower ceiling.</p><p>If you run a company, you're no doubt familiar with the efficiency gains that arise when different employees and departments operate with high trust. Links form easily given an assumption of low risk, and knowledge moves more quickly, fluidly. Networks then facilitate trust in a virtuous cycle, an example being the military as an integrating institution in a multi-ethnic society.</p><p>Trust based on family has its own advantages, but for now I'm focused on an economy's ceiling, and networks that throw off the shackles of family-based firms can scale more. China not only has the population to supply a workforce that can assemble 100 million iPhones in a year, it has an economy that has moved beyond any roots in family-based trust.</p><p>Hidalgo's theory also explains why we don't see geographic leakage in industry know-how. Why aren't there Silicon Valleys everywhere?</p><blockquote>The personbyte theory can also help us explain why large chunks of knowledge and knowhow are hard to accumulate and transfer, and why knowledge and knowhow are organized in the hierarchical pattern that is expressed in the nestedness of the industry-location data. This is because large chunks of knowledge and knowhow need large networks of people to be embodied in, and transferring or duplicating large networks is not as easy as transferring a small group of people. As a result, industry-location networks are nested, and countries move to products that are close by in the product space.<br /> </blockquote><p>When the knowledge required to create something like an iPhone or a Hollywood film require the interaction of multiple people, with all their accumulated knowledge, seizing it for yourself isn't as easy as poaching one employee or sprinting off with a burning branch to give fire to mankind like Prometheus. Thus we understand why, besides its weather,&nbsp;LA has such a grip on filmmaking for the global market,&nbsp;why any handset manufacturers can't just reverse engineer an iPhone, and why, despite having hundreds of millions of users for iMessages, Apple isn't a credible threat in social networking.</p><p>When I study the Chinese tech market, I see an incredibly high ceiling. In fact, the Chinese consumer market in tech is more dynamic now than its counterpart in Silicon Valley. Once, China was belittled for simply copying all the US tech companies. It's true, there is a Chinese Bizarro instance of all successful U.S. tech companies, a Chinese Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and so on.</p><p>Thanks to that complex interaction of culture and technology, however, China now creates companies with no real American equivalents, and that extends beyond WeChat. China also has more dense cities than America, and density creates its own unique consumer technology opportunities. You'll run out of fingers and toes before you come to a Chinese city as small as New York City, and that matters when many social products piggyback and rely on metropolitan densities as dry kindling.</p><p>The competition between tech companies in the U.S. draws scandalized chatter from the peanut gallery, but the pace at which something like Snapchat Stories was copied in the U.S. would be seen as laughably slow in China. Not only are features of competitors routinely copied within a week or two in China, employees are poached all the time in what is closer to a true approximation of a free labor market than even Silicon Valley. Knowledge moves quickly, freely.</p><p>Three things, in my observation, hold Chinese companies back from capturing more share in the international market, outside Chinese borders. Two are related, and those are an internationally appealing industrial and software design aesthetic.</p><p>It's true, people who find many Chinese software UI's to be busy and crowded can't read Chinese and thus don't understand their localized appeal to the Chinese market. As eye-tracking studies have shown (<a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/chinese-eye-tracking-study-baidu-vs-google-11477\" target=\"_blank\">example</a>), Chinese users scan pages differently, and why shouldn't they considering the fundamental differences between an alphabetic language like English and a pictographic one like Chinese?</p><p>Still, most of the international market can't read Chinese. In my past work with UI designers in China, I find it takes more prompting to arrive at something more broadly intuitive for, say, an American market.</p><p>The same goes for industrial design, where, akin to the denser informational aesthetic of Chinese software, a somewhat more maximalist impulse takes hold. It's still quite common to walk into an Asian electronics superstore and see display signage that lists dozens of bullet points of features in selling a product. Contrast that to the almost non-existent signage in an Apple store for the extreme opposite.</p><p>A more tangible example is something like the user interface of everyone's favorite cooking gadget, the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2DlswrG\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Pot</a>. I received one as a gift last year, and no doubt, I think it's a real value at $80 or so for the base model. For how harried we all feel, a pressure cooker is way more useful a kitchen gadget than most.</p><p>However, this is the instrument panel on the front of the Instant Pot.</p>\n",

      "<p>In practice, it's even more confusing than it appears on first glance. I won't delve into it here, but given a simple design pass, the entire UI could be made much less intimidating, much more intuitive. Given the functionality of any pressure cooker,&nbsp;the functionality can be reduced to a much simpler instrumentation.</p><p>These two skill gaps in software and industrial design allow for a continued Kickstarter arbitrage opportunity that slaps a more internationally appealing software and industrial design, along with the more internationally appealing marketing, on top of Shenzhen's manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>The last thing holding back more Chinese startups, in my experience, is a shortage in the professional management class. I know, I know, MBA's get a bad rap in the domestic market, but having many CEO's with engineering background at so many Chinese tech companies comes with its own drawbacks.</p><p>This management gap may be related to the style of org structure and management which others have mentioned to me as less conducive to certain types of innovation, though it's harder for me to assess without having worked inside a Chinese company.</p><p>None of this needs to matter since the Chinese market is so massive. Chinese startups can succeed wildly without ever making a peep outside their home territory. Besides, how a design aesthetic and process can seep into a country's soul remains a mystery to me, but my guess is it's about as slow-moving as trying to produce a high quality soup dumpling in a new market.</p><p>Still, I love to muse on the potential of China. In fact, there is <a href=\"https://www.dji.com/\" target=\"_blank\">one Chinese company</a> that best exemplifies the potential of the country's tech market on the international stage. Last summer, a friend of mine who had worked at this company heard I was in the market for a drone and referred me to a friend who was selling an extra, lightly used <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2CSVziV\" target=\"_blank\">Mavic Pro</a> which he'd purchased after he thought he'd lost his original.</p><p>I don't know the first thing about flying drones, but it took me all of fifteen minutes or so to get the thing up and flying around in the air, capturing 4K video. It is an fantastic feat of engineering, probably still the single drone I'd recommend to anyone looking to get into drone photography (though I recommend getting a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2qW7LxM\" target=\"_blank\">bundle</a> with some extra batteries and a carrying case).</p><p>DJI had a few advantages in surging to its undisputed leadership position in the global drone market. First, this is a product category where how well the product actually works is more complex a task than in others. Many drones just don't fly that well. Being an engineering-led company is a strength here, and as long as the industrial design is optimized for flight, it doesn't really matter if your product isn't the sleekest. You won't care what it looks like when it's several hundred feet up in the air.</p><p>Second, from a software design perspective, drone UI design can piggyback on flight UI templates that have been worked out over the years. One reason I was up and running so quickly with my Mavic Pro is that the flight sticks imitate video game flight controls. The UI isn't quite as simple as I'd like, but I was fluent much more quickly than the hefty page count of the instruction manual implied.</p><p>Estimates of DJI's market share vary, but they are all well north of 50%, and most of its competitors have either left the market entirely or are struggling to stay aloft, so to speak. Here is a vertically integrated Chinese company that most definitely makes more than the cost of cheap SF lunch that Foxconn makes for each iPhone it assembles.</p><p>Now, making drones and building smartphones or writing apps are not the same skills. Drones, as exciting as they are, still aren't the type of thing I'd recommend except to photography enthusiasts. And China is a long way from dominating the consumer electronics market internationally with a massive portfolio of products from domestic, vertically integrated companies.</p><p>But the ceiling at least exists. it's not theoretical. It's more than any other country outside the U.S. can say, and how China answers it is one of the questions which will determine the relative economic power of China versus the United States in this century.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">***</p><p>That China can export drones more easily than it can import, say, the software and industrial design know-how of a company like Apple is, at a higher level, a fundamental question of how we can pass along knowledge of any sort. Why are we not better at transferring know-how to industrial workers who are out of a job, why hasn't the internet produced a global leveling of industrial know-how at the country level?</p><p>Hidalgo notes:</p><blockquote>At a finer scale, economies still lack the intimate connection between knowhow and information that is embodied in DNA and which allows biological organisms to pack knowhow so tightly. A book on engineering, art, or music can help develop an engineer, artist, or musician, but it can hardly do so with the elegance, grace, and efficiency with which a giraffe embryo unpacks its DNA to build a giraffe. The ability of economies to pack and unpack knowhow by physically embodying instructions and templates as written information is much more limited than the equivalent ability in biological organisms.<br /> </blockquote><p>We are nowhere near our maximum throughput for passing on our knowledge to our fellow man, let alone across the membrane between companies and economies.

      "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_movie_club/features/2018/movie_club_2017/the_rules_of_movie_stardom_are_broken.html\" target=\"_blank\">All the old rules about movie stardom are broken</a>, part of Slate's 2017 Movie Club year end review, Amy Nicholson writes:</p><blockquote><p>Lugging my $10 masterpiece back to the hotel, I thought about how most of the famous faces who represent the movies have been dead for 50 years. Marilyn’s smile sells shot glasses, clocks, calendars, posters, and shirts in stores from Sunset Boulevard to Buenos Aires, Tijuana to Taiwan. What modern actor could earn a seat at her table? The biggest stars of my lifetime—Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Nicolas Cage, Sandra Bullock—never graduated past magazine covers to souvenir magnets.<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If Hollywood played by its old rules,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slate.com/arts/2017/12/i-tonya-the-tonya-harding-movie-reviewed.html\"><em>I, Tonya</em></a>’s Margot Robbie and <a href=\"https://slate.com/arts/2017/11/call-me-by-your-name-with-armie-hammer-reviewed.html\"><em>Call Me by Your Name</em></a>’s Armie Hammer should be huge stars. They’re funny, smart, self-aware, charismatic, and freakishly attractive. Yet, they feel like underdogs, and I’m trying to figure out why. Robbie has made intelligent choices. Her scene-stealing introduction as Leonardo DiCaprio’s trophy wife in<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2013/12/scorsese_s_wolf_of_wall_street_starring_leonardo_dicaprio_reviewed.html\"><em>Wolf of Wall Street</em></a><em>.</em>&nbsp;Her classic romantic caper with Will Smith in the underseen trifle,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Focus-Will-Smith/dp/B00U2C3ZWQ?tag=slatmaga-20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Focus</em></a>. She even survived <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2016/08/suicide_squad_starring_will_smith_and_jared_leto_reviewed.html\"><em>Suicide Squad</em></a>&nbsp;with her dignity intact. In <em>I, Tonya</em>, she can’t outskate being miscast as Tonya Harding, but bless her heart for trying. As for Hammer, Kameron, your review of <em>Call Me by Your Name</em>&nbsp;called him, “<a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/11/24/16691712/call-me-by-your-name-film-review-armie-hammer\" target=\"_blank\">royally handsome</a>,” which seems right. He’s as ridiculously perfect as a cartoon prince, and I loved how Luca Guadagnino made a joke of how outlandish the 6-foot-5 blond looks in the Italian countryside. Whether he’s unfurling himself from a tiny Fiat or stopping conversation with his gangly dance moves, he can’t blend in—and good on him and Guadagnino for embracing it.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>But even if Robbie and Hammer each claim an Oscar nomination this year, I suspect they’ll stay stalled out in this strange time when great actors are simply supporting players in a superhero franchise. I’m fascinated by Robbie and Hammer because they’re like fossils of some alpha carnivore that should have thrived. Does anyone else feel like the tectonic plates under Hollywood have shifted and we’re now staring at the evidence that everything we know is extinct? It’s not just that the old rules have changed—no new rules have replaced them.&nbsp;No one seems to know what works.</p></blockquote><p>Nicholson goes on to cite Will Smith, who once had huge hits seemingly with every movie he made and who is now on a long cold streak.</p><p>I'm wary of all conclusions drawn about media in the scarcity age, including the idea that people went to see movies because of movie stars. It's not that Will Smith isn't charismatic. He is. But I suspect Will Smith was in a lot of hits in the age of scarcity in large part because there weren't a lot of other entertainment options vying for people's attention when Independence Day or something of its ilk came out, like clockwork, to launch the summer blockbuster season.</p><p>The same goes for the general idea that any one star was ever the chief engine for a film's box office. If the idea that people go see a movie just to see any one star was never actually true, we can stop holding the modern generation of movie stars to an impossible standard.</p><p>The same mistake, I think, is being made about declining NFL ratings. Owners blame players kneeling for the national anthem, but here's my theory: in an age of infinite content, NFL games measure up poorly as entertainment, especially for a generation that grew up with smartphones and no cable TV and thus little exposure to American football. If I weren't in two fantasy football leagues with friends and coworkers, I would not have watched a single game this season, and that's a Leftovers-scale flash-forward twist for a kid who once recorded the Superbowl Shuffle to cassette tape off a local radio broadcast just to practice the lyrics.</p><p>If you disregard any historical romantic notions and examine the typical NFL football game, it is mostly dead time (if you watch a cut-down version of a game using Sunday Ticket, only about 30 minutes of a 3 to 3.5 hr game involves actual game action), with the majority of plays involving action of only incremental consequence, whose skill and strategy on display are opaque to most viewers and which are explained poorly by a bunch of middle-aged white men who know little about how to sell the romance of the game to a football neophyte. Several times each week, you might see a player hit so hard that they lie on the ground motionless, or with their hands quivering, foreshadowing a lifetime of pain, memory loss, and depression brought on by irreversible brain damage. If you tried to pitch that show concept just on its structural merits you'd be laughed out of the room in Hollywood.</p><p>Cultural products must regenerate themselves for each successive age and generation or risk becoming like opera or the symphony is today. I had season tickets to the LA Phil when I lived in Los Angeles, and I brought a friend to the season opener one year. A reporter actually stopped us as we walked out to interview us about why we were there, so mysterious it was to see two attendees who weren't old enough to have been contemporaries of the composer of the music that night (Mahler).</p><p>Yes, football has been around for decades, but most of those were in an age of entertainment scarcity. During that time the NFL capitalized on being the only game in town on Sundays, capturing an audience that passed on the game and its liturgies to their children. Football resembles a religion or any other cultural social network; humans being a tribal creature, we find products that satisfy that need, and what are professional sports leagues but an alliance of clans who band together for the network effects of ritual tribal warfare?</p><p>Because of its long incubation in an era of low entertainment competition, the NFL built up massive distribution power and enormous financial coffers. That it is a cultural product transmitted by one generation to the next through multiple channels means it's not entirely fair to analyze it independent of its history; cultural products have some path dependence.</p><p>Nevertheless, even if you grant it all its tailwinds, I don't trust a bunch of rich old white male owners who grew up in such favorable monopolistic conditions to both understand and adapt in time to rescue the NFL from continued decline in cultural relevance. They are like tortoises who grew up in the Galapagos Islands, shielded on all sides from predators by the ocean, who one day see the moat dry up, connecting them all of a sudden to other continents where an infinite variety of fast-moving predators dwell. I'm not sure the average NFL owner could unlock an iPhone X, let alone understand the way its product moves through modern cultural highways.</p><p>Other major sports leagues are in the same boat though most aren't as oblivious as the NFL. The NBA has an open-minded commissioner in Adam Silver and some younger owners who made their money in technology and at least have one foot in modernity. As a sport, the NBA has some structural advantages over other sports (for example, player faces are visible rather than hidden under helmets), but the league also helps by allowing highlights of games to be clipped and shared on social media and by encouraging its players to cultivate more authentic public personas that act as additional narrative fodder for audiences.</p><p>I remember sitting in a meeting with some NFL representatives as they outlined a long list of their restrictions for how their televised games could be remixed and shared by fans on social media. Basically, they wanted almost none of it and would pursue take-downs through all the major social media companies.</p><p>Make no mistake, one possible successful strategy in this age of abundant media is to double down on scarcity. It's often the optimal strategy for extracting the maximum revenue from a motivated customer segment. Taylor Swift and other such unicorns can only release their albums on CD for a window to maximize financial return from her superfans before releasing the album on streaming services, straight from the old media windowing playbook.</p><p>However, you'd better be damn sure your product is unique and compelling to dial up that tactic because the far greater risk in the age of abundance is that you put up walls around your content and set up a bouncer at the door and no one shows up because there are dozens of free clubs all over town with no cover charge.</p><p>Sports have long had one massive advantage in production costs over scripted entertainment like TV and movies, and that is that their narrative engine is a random number generator (RNG). If you want to produce the next hot streaming series, you have to pay millions of dollars to showrunners and writers to generate some narrative.</p><p>In sports, the narrative is embedded in the rules of the game. Some players will compete, and someone will win. It's the same script replayed every night, but the RNG produces infinite variations that then spin off infinite variations of the same narratives for why a game turned out one way or the other, just as someone has to make up a story every day to explain why the stock market went up or down. At last check, RNG hadn't found representation with CAA or WME or UTA and thus its services remain free.</p><p>Unfortunately for major sports, this advantage is now a weakness as sports narrative is much more brittle than its entertainment counterparts. Narrative is a hedge against disaggregation and unbundling, and that is a critical moat in this age of social media and the internet.</p><p>One way to measure entertainment value on this dimension is to ask whether you can read a summary of a narrative and enjoy it almost as much as consuming the original narrative in its native medium. My classic test of this is for movies and TV shows. If you can enjoy a movie just as much by reading the Wikipedia plot summary as by watching it, or if you can enjoy a TV shows almost as much by reading a recap than by bingeing it on your sofa, then it wasn't really that great a movie or TV show to begin with.</p><p>Instead of watching the entire last season of Game of Thrones when it returns in 2019, I offer you the alternative of just reading textual recaps to your hearts content online. Is that as enticing an alternative as actually watching all six or seven episodes? You'll ingest all the plot details either way, but for the vast majority of fans this would be a gut-wrenching downgrade.</p><p>My other test of narrative value is a variant of the previous compression test. Can you enjoy something just as much by just watching a tiny fraction of the best moments? If so, the narrative is brittle. If you can watch just the last scene of a movie and get most or all the pleasure of watching the whole thing, the narrative didn't earn your company for the journey.</p><p>Much more of sports fails this second test than many sports fans realize. I can watch highlights of most games on ESPN or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/houseofhighlights/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">HouseofHighlights</a> on Instagram and extract most of the entertainment marrow and cultural capital of knowing what happened without having to sit through three hours of mostly commercials and dead time. That a game can be unbundled so easily into individual plays and retain most of its value to me might be seen as a good thing in the age of social media, but it's not ideal for the sports leagues if those excerpts are mostly viewed outside paywalls.</p><p>This is the bind for major sports leagues. On the one hand, you can try to keep all your content inside the paywall. On the other hand, doing so probably means you continue hemorrhaging&nbsp; cultural share. This is the eternal dilemma for all media companies in the age of infinite content.</p><p>Two nights ago, I watched a clip of multiple angles of Tua Tagovailoa ripping a laser beam of a pass to win the National Championship for Alabama. I didn't watch it live, or on ESPN. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdt43kfhPTe/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=houseofhighlights\" target=\"_blank\">I watched it on HouseofHighlights on Instagram</a>, where, instead of hearing some anchor on Sportscenter basically tell me what I can see with my own eyes, the video spins around after a moment to reveal the stunned face of the fan who just witnessed the pass live, reaction videos being a new sort of genre which allows a person in the video to act as the emoji reaction caption from within the video itself, speaking a visual language that most young people of this YouTube/Snapchat generation are already familiar with but which traditional media doesn't notice, let alone grok.</p><p>This disaggregation problem extends to ESPN, currently still the 400 pound gorilla in the sports media jungle (reminder, <a href=\"https://www.adventure-journal.com/2015/12/do-gorillas-really-weigh-800-pounds/\" target=\"_blank\">there are no 800 lb gorillas</a>). The network suspended Jemele Hill for tweeting something negative about Trump, using the same playbook as the NFL, who threatened players with suspension for kneeling for the national anthem. Both believed these actions on the part of their talent were harming the value of their product.</p><p>The irony is that if both ESPN and the NFL had let these things play out naturally, I suspect at worst it would have been neutral, and at best it might have increased their ratings. For the NFL, the ties to modern movements for social justice might have kept the league and its games in the national conversation and made it tangentially relevant to the next generation. The most culturally relevant bit of Sportscenter today may just be the Sportscenter Top 10, as athletes who make a stunning play routinely tell reporters they are excited to see if they'll be featured on that evening's roundup of the top 10 plays.</p><p>Unfortunately, many athletes already see an appearance in HouseofHighlights as the social media alternative to appearing in the Sportscenter Top 10. If you follow top athletes on Instagram, you can see which of them favorite posts on HouseofHighlights. Lebron James routinely favorites posts, as do many other stars. Since many of those athletes follow each other on Instagram, that feature of Instagram produces common knowledge. It's not just that Donovan Mitchell knows that Lebron James favorited a HouseofHighlights clip of him dunking, it's that Mitchell knows that James knows that Mitchell knows and so on.</p><p>For ESPN, hewing to the idea that only highlights presented dispassionately or games broadcast respectfully are key to their value is a risky one. Not that they haven't generated a ton of wealth from doing so, and not that TV broadcast rights to major sports aren't still extremely valuable, but those are much more fixed commodities, available to the highest bidder, and ones whose value are close to their peaks, if not past them. This can't be a complete surprise within the four walls of their corporate offices given how much salary and air time they devote to blowhards like Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless, but their hesitance to lean into cultivating more original voices will haunt them in the long run. The average caption on an Instagram clip of a major sports league highlight is about twice as likely to be fresh and contextually humorous to a young person than any amount of generic sportscaster hooey spouted on ESPN.</p><p>This vulnerability extends to their online presences. I still visit ESPN.com on the web and on my mobile devices to get my sports news roundup each day, but sometime in the past few years, the designs of all these presences shifted dramatically. Gone was a hierarchical layout with different sized headlines and groupings of stories. In its place is a long center gutter of updates from a variety of sports leagues, in modern news feed style.</p><p>One can see why they went this way, it made ESPN more current, allowing them to push the latest stories to the top of the page to compete with people getting more current updates from Twitter and other social media sites. For a smartphone, in particular, with its limited screen space, it's not easy to block content into multiple sections on one page.</p><p>However, the moment you copy someone else's design, you've shifted the terms of the debate in their favor. In a previous era, ESPN's visually distinct information hierarchy set itself up as the authority on what stories mattered. In the new design, what matters skews towards what's the last thing to happen. It's all flow.</p><p>To some extent, in our hyper-personalized world, the era of any media entity deciding what stories matter more than others was always going to decline from what might be seen now as a temporary heyday. I care more about Chicago sports teams and Stanford given my background, so having those elements given more prominence was a notable improvement in the site's newly personalized design. Still, what is lost is that sense of authority, that ESPN sets the terms of the debate. Humans remain a social animal, and we take cues about what matters from our each other, including our media entities. ESPN has ceded more and more of the work of determining our sports Schelling points to other entities.</p><p>While this may sound grim, the major sports, their respective leagues, and ESPN all have a fairly solid near term window. For one thing, sports is still the highest volume, highest popularity real-time entertainment. As such, it remains a linchpin of many entertainment packages including cable bundles, and so we'll see various media companies pouring money into it until it can't hold things together anymore. We may even see the prices bid even higher for some time as often happens for assets being milked for their last but fleeting window of cultural scarcity.</p><p>A second and less discussed factor is that most young tech CEO's don't know the first thing about sports. They, like a sizable part of Silicon Valley (the group that tweets #sportsball whenever Twitter is inundated with reactions to some notable sports event), grew up with other interests. Without that intuitive sense of sports' place in culture, they aren't as attuned to the opportunities in that category.</p><p>This provides the leagues opportunities to swindle the tech companies for a while longer, an example being the rights to stream Thursday Night Football, which a series of tech companies from Yahoo to Twitter to Amazon have (probably) overpaid for the last few seasons. As Patrick Stewart said in <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mipV7j\" target=\"_blank\">L.A. Story</a>, \"You think with a statement like this you can have the duck?!\" The chef says, \"He can have the chicken!\" Thursday Night Football is zee chicken of the NFL broadcast portfolio, but the restaurant is still called L'Idiot.</p><p>This happened for tech companies when they tried to add film and television to their portfolio, too. They routinely paid fortunes for the rights to back seasons of shows that are no longer relevant anymore. When I was at Hulu, I could only shake my head when I heard the asking price for all the back seasons of Seinfeld. Years later, long after I'd left, Hulu paid multiples of that. The cultural decay curve for content in this age of abundance is accelerating by the day, and there is no equivalent of botox to ward it off.</p><p>Given market feedback, however, such temporary arbitrage never lasts long. The days of the NFL strong-arming its partners to overpay for the most meager of rights are coming to an end. The thing about setting up a moat around your content is that the moment your cultural value crosses its peak, the moat becomes a set of prison bars. The flywheel loop can turn just as furiously counter-clockwise as clockwise.</p><p>And one of these days, a tech company will look at ESPN's homepage and notice how much it looks like their own. If they just put a bit more structure around it, could they satisfy that sports itch for their captive audience which already check in with them multiple times a day?</p><p>It seems implausible today, but look at what happened in film and television. For the longest time, so many tech companies were guilty of exactly what Hollywood accused them of, not understanding how film and television is made and marketed, how that industry creates demand for its product. Like all engineering led-cultures, Silicon Valley suspected Hollywood of not being data-driven enough, and many suspected that upstream process failures were responsible for failed releases. Half a film's budget is spent on prints and marketing? What a waste! (Engineers despise marketing.)</p><p>Forget that most of these people in tech had never been on a film set, or sat inside a writer's room, or seen the volumes of market research done before any film's release. It's all just content, let's just crowd source some alternatives. Or, if we produce some premium content, what's needed is earlier crowd-sourced feedback. Hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted before Silicon Valley realized they didn't know what they were doing.</p><p>Fortunately, all it cost them was some money and some time, something most of the incumbents have a surplus of. Now they write checks to creatives in Hollywood and leave them alone to do what they do very well already. Machine learning improves with data even when the algorithms are off, and so do most tech companies.</p><p>I am a lifelong lover of media in all its forms, and sports in particular was central to how I assimilated into America. It has long served as cultural connective tissue between me and friends, family, and strangers. But if I had an easy way to short all the major sports leagues over the next decade, I would. Nostalgia serves many purposes, but its most dangerous one is wrapping us in a memory of a time when we were still relevant.</p>~\n",
      "<p>One of the things anyone who has worked on textual conversation interfaces, like chatbots, will tell you is that the challenge is dealing with the long tail of crazy things people will type. People love to abuse chatbots. Something about text-based conversation UI's invites Turing tests. Every game player remembers the moment they first abandoned their assigned mission in Grand Theft Auto to start driving around the city crashing into cars, running over pedestrians, just to exercise their freedom and explore just what happens when they escape the plot mechanic tree.</p><p>However, this type of user roaming or trolling happens much less with voice interfaces. Sure, the first time a user tries Siri or Alexa or whatever Google's voice assistant is called (it really needs a name, IMO, to avoid inheriting everything the word \"Google\" stands for), they may ask something ridiculous or snarky. However, that type of rogue input tends to trail off quickly, whereas it doesn't in textual conversation UI's.</p><p>I suspect some form of the uncanny valley and blame the affordances of text interfaces. Most text conversation UI's are visually indistinguishable from those of a messaging UI used to communicate primarily with other human beings. Thus it invites the user to probe its intelligence boundaries. Unfortunately, the seamless polish of the UI isn't matched by the capabilities of chatbots today, most of which are just dumb trees.</p><p>On the other hand, none of the voice assistants to date sounds close to replicating the natural way a human speaks. These voice assistants may have more human timbre, but the stiff elocution, the mispronunciations, the frequent mistakes in comprehension, all quickly inform the user that what they are dealing with is something of quite limited intelligence. The affordances draw palpable, if invisible, boundaries in the user's mind, and they quickly realize the low ROI on trying anything other than what is likely to be in the hard-coded response tree. In fact, I'd argue that the small jokes that these UI's insert, like answering random questions like \"what is the meaning of life?\" may actually set these assistants up to disappoint people even more by encouraging more such questions the assistant isn't ready to answer (I found it amusing when Alexa answered my question, \"Is Jon Snow dead?\" two seasons ago, but then was disappointed when it still had the same abandoned answer a season later, after the question had already been answered by the program months ago).</p><p>The same invisible boundaries work immediately when speaking to one of those automated voice customer service menus. You immediately know to speak to these as if you're addressing an idiot who is also hard of hearing, and the goal is to complete the interaction as quickly as possible, or to divert to a human customer service rep at the earliest possible moment.</p><p>[I read on Twitter that one shortcut to get to a human when speaking to an automated voice response system is to curse, that the use of profanity is often a built-in trigger to turn you over to an operator. This is both an amusing and clever design but also feels like some odd admission of guilt on the part of the system designer.]</p><p>It is not easy, given the simplicity of textual UIs, to lower the user's expectations. However, given where the technology is for now, it may be necessary to erect such guardrails. Perhaps the font for the assistant should be some fixed-width typeface, to distinguish it from a human. Maybe some mechanical sound effects could convey the robotic nature of the machine writing the words, and perhaps the syntax should be less human in some ways, to lower expectations.</p><p>One of the huge problems with voice assistants, after all, is that the failures, when they occur, feel catastrophic from the user perspective. I may try a search on Google that doesn't return the results I want, but at least something comes back, and I'm usually sympathetic to the idea that what I want may not exist in an easily queryable form on the internet. However, though voice assistant errors occur much less frequently than before, when they do, it feels as if you're speaking to a careless design, and I mean careless in all sense of the word, from poorly crafted (why didn't the developer account for this obvious query) and uncaring (as in emotionally cold).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Couples go to counseling over feeling as if they aren't being heard by each other. Some technology can get away with promising more than they can deliver, but when it comes to tech that is built around conversation, with all the expectations that very human mode of communication has accrued over the years, it's a dangerous game. In a map of the human brain, the neighborhoods of \"you don't understand\" and \"you don't care\" share a few exit ramps.</p>~\n",

The French philosopher Michel Foucault theorised that meditating and journalling could help to bring a person inside herself by allowing her, at least temporarily, to escape the world and her relationship to it. But the sociologist Paul du Gay, writing on this subject in 1996,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/consumption-and-identity-at-work/book202586\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a>&nbsp;that few people treat the self as Foucault proposed. Most people, he said, craft outward-looking ‘enterprising selves’ by which they set out to acquire cultural capital in order to move upwards in the world, gain access to certain social circles, certain jobs, and so on. We decorate ourselves and cultivate interests that reflect our social aspirations. In this way, the self becomes the ultimate capitalist machine, a Pierre Bourdieu-esque nightmare that willingly exploits itself.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>‘Growing up’ as it is defined today – that is, as entering society, once and for all – might work against what is morally justifiable. If you are a part of a flawed, immoral and unjust society (as one could argue we all are) then to truly mature is to see this as a problem and to act on it – not to reaffirm it by becoming a part of it. Classically, most coming-of-age tales follow white, male protagonists because their integration into society is expected and largely unproblematic. Social integration for racial, sexual and gender minorities is a more difficult process, not least because minorities define themselves against the norm: they don’t ‘find themselves’ and integrate into the social context in which they live. A traditional coming-of-age story featuring a queer, black girl will fail on its own terms; for how would her discovering her identity allow her to enter a society that insists on marginalising identities like hers? This might seem obvious, but it very starkly underscores the folly of insisting on seeing social integration as the young person’s top priority. Life is a wave of events. As such, you don’t come of age; you just age. Adulthood, if one must define it, is only a function of time, in which case, to come of age is merely to live long enough to do so.<br /> </blockquote><p>I've written about this before, but almost always, the worst type of film festival movie is about a young white male protagonist coming of age. Often he's quiet, introverted, but he has a sensitive soul. As my first year film school professor said, these protagonists are inert, but they just \"feel things.\"&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qssvnjj5Moo\" target=\"_blank\">Think Wes Bentley in American Beauty filming a plastic bag dancing in the wind for fifteen minutes with a camcorder, then showing it to a girl as if it's Citizen Kane</a>.</p><p>If they have any scars or wounds, they are compensated for with extreme gifts.

It reminds me of the distinction between <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2iXCRyB\" target=\"_blank\">Finite and Infinite Games</a>, the classic book from James Carse. The Hollywood film has always promised a finite game, and thus it's a story that must have an ending. Coming-of-age is an infinite game, or at least until death, and so we should all be skeptical of its close-ended narrative.</p><p>(h/t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhdempsey\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Dempsey</a>)</p><p>2.

They are not accustomed to having spent their entire lives being named in almost every piece of culture as a race, the way women, people of color, and the union of the two are, every single day, by society and culture.<br /><br />All Lives Matter retort to Black Lives Matter is to pretend that we're all playing the same finite game when almost everyone who are losers in that game know it is not true. Blacks do not feel like they “won” the Civil War; every day today they live with the consequences and the shadow of America's founding racism, every day they continue to play a game that is rigged against them. That is why Ta Nehisi Coates <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/08/no-confederate/535512/\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a> that the question of The Confederate is a lie, and that only the victors of this finite game of America would want to relitigate the Civil War in some Alt History television show for HBO. It's as if a New England Patriot fan asked an Atlanta Falcons fan to watch last year's Super Bowl again, with Armie Hammer playing Tom Brady.<br /><br />“Give us your poor, your huddled” is a promise that the United States is an infinite game, an experiment that struggles constantly towards bettering itself, evening the playing field, such that even someone starting poor and huddled might one day make a better life and escape their beginning state. That is why Stephen Miller and other white nationalists spitting on that inscription on the Statue of Liberty is so offensive, so dangerous.</p><p>On society, Carse writes:</p><blockquote>The prizes won by its citizens can be protected only if the society as a whole remains powerful in relation to other societies. Those who desire the permanence of their prizes will work to sustain the permanence of the whole. Patriotism in one or several of its many forms (chauvinism, racism, sexism, nationalism, regionalism) is an ingredient in all societal play.&nbsp;<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Because power is inherently patriotic, is is characteristic of finite players to seek a growth of power in a society as a way of increasing the power of a society.<br /> </blockquote><p>Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for the National Anthem is seen as unpatriotic by many in America, including the wealthy white owners of such teams, which is not surprising, as racism is a form of patriotism, per Carse, and part and parcel of American society when defined as a finite game.<br /><br />Donald Trump and his <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-land-of-the-large-adult-son\" target=\"_blank\">large adult sons</a>&nbsp;are proof of just how powerful the inheritance of title and money are in America, and the irony that they are elected by those who feel that successive rounds of finite games have started to be rigged against them is not lost on anyone, not even, I suspect, them. One could argue they need to take a lesson from those oppressed for far longer as to how a turn to nihilism works out in such situations.<br /><br />Those attacking Affirmative Action want to close off the American experiment and turn it into a series of supposedly level finite games because they have accumulated a healthy lead in this game and wish to preserve it in every form.<br /><br />White nationalists like Trump all treat America as not just a finite game, but a zero sum finite game. The idea of immigrants being additive to America, to its potential, its output, is to treat America as an infinite game, open-ended. The truth lies, as usual, between the poles, but closer to the latter.</p><p>Beware the prophet who comes with stories of zero-sum games, or as Jim Collins once wrote,&nbsp;beware the \"tyranny of the or.\" One of my definitions of leadership is the ability to turn zero-sum into positive sum games.</p><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/curb-your-enthusiasm-is-running-out-of-people-to-offend\" target=\"_blank\">Curb Your Enthusiasm is Running Out of People to Offend </a></p><p>Speaking of fatigue with white male protagonists:</p><blockquote>But if Larry David’s casual cruelty mirrors the times more than ever, the show might still fit awkwardly in the current moment. Watching the première of Season 9 on Sunday night, I kept thinking of a popular line from George Costanza, David’s avatar on “Seinfeld”: “You know, we’re living in a <em>society</em>!” Larry, in this first episode of the season, seems to have abandoned society altogether. In the opening shot, the camera sails over a tony swath of L.A., with no people and only a few cars visible amid the manicured lawns and terra-cotta roofs. It descends on Larry’s palatial, ivy-walled house, where he showers alone, singing Mary Poppins’s “A Spoonful of Sugar” and bludgeoning a bottle of soap. (Its dispenser pump is broken—grounds for execution under the David regime.) He’s the master of his domain, yes, but only by default: no one else is around.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>“Curb” has always felt insulated, and a lot of its best jokes are borne of the fact that Larry’s immense wealth has warped his world view over the years. (On the most recent season he had no compunction about spending a princely sum on Girl Scout Cookies, only to rescind the order out of spite.) But the beginning of Season 9 offers new degrees of isolation. Like a tech bro ensconced in a hoodie and headphones, Larry seems to have removed himself almost entirely from public life. Both “Curb” and “Seinfeld” like to press the limits of etiquette and social mores, but the latter often tested these on subway cars and buses, in parks or on the street. Much of “Curb,” by contrast, unfolds in a faceless Los Angeles of air-conditioned mansions, organic restaurants, and schmoozy fund-raisers, a long chain of private spaces. The only time Larry encounters a true stranger, it’s in the liminal zone between his car and the lobby of Jeff’s office. She’s a barber on her way to see Jeff at work—even haircuts happen behind closed doors now.<br /> </blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Curb Your Enthusiasm is a dark parody of Groundhog Day in which a rich white guy acts like more and more of a selfish jerk to all his friends but no matter what he does, the next morning they're still his friends.</p>— Eugene Wei (@eugenewei) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eugenewei/status/932344242550091776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2017</a></blockquote>\n",

Whereas Bill Murray wakes up each morning to Sonny and Cher, trapped in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, around small town people he dislikes, in a job he feels superior to, Larry David wakes up each morning in his Los Angeles mansion, with rewards seemingly only proportionate to the depths of his pettiness and ill humor. Every episode, he treats all the friends and family around him with little disguised disdain, and yet the next episode, he wakes up in the mansion again.</p><p>Whereas Bill Murray eventually realizes the way to break out of his loop is to use it for self-improvement, Larry David seems to be striving to fall from grace by acting increasingly terrible and yet finds himself back in the gentle embrace of his high thread count sheets every morning.</p><p>Curb Your Enthusiasm has its moments of brilliance in its minute dissection of the sometimes illogical and perhaps fragile bonds of societal goodwill, and its episode structure is often exceedingly clever, but I can't help watching it now as nothing more than an acerbic piece of performance art, with all the self absorption that implies.</p><p>Larry David recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rsquared/status/915726142119620608\" target=\"_blank\">complained about the concept of first world problems</a>, which is humorous, as it's difficult to think of any single person who has done as precise a job educating the world on what they are.</p><p>[What about Harvey Weinstein and Louis C.K., you might ask?

We have devalued the term LOL with overuse, but no show has made me literally laugh out loud by myself, on the sofa, as this, though I've grinned in pleasure at certain precise bits of stylistic parody of <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80117545\" target=\"_blank\">American Vandal</a>.</p><p>Nathan Fielder plays a comedic version of himself. In the opening credits, he proclaims:</p><blockquote>My name is Nathan Fielder, and I graduated from one of Canada's top business schools with really good grades [NOTE: as he says this, we see a pan over his transcript, showing largely B's and C's]. Now I'm using my knowledge to help struggling small business owners make it in this competitive world.<br /> </blockquote><p>If you cringed while watching a show like Borat or Ali G, if you wince a bit when one of the correspondents on The Daily Show went to interview some stooge, you might believe Nathan For You isn't, well, for you. However, the show continues to surprise me.</p><p>For one thing, it's a deeply useful reminder of how difficult it is for physical retailers, especially mom and pop entrepreneurs, to generate foot traffic. That they go along with Fielder's schemes is almost tragic, but more instructive.</p><p>For another, while almost every entrepreneur is the straight person to Fielder's clown, I find myself heartened by how rarely one of them just turns him away outright. You can see the struggle on each of their faces, as he presents his idea and then stares at them for an uncomfortably long silence, waiting for them to respond. He never breaks character. Should they just laugh at him, or throw him out in disgust? It almost never happens, though one private investigator does chastise Fielder for being a complete loser.</p><p>On Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David's friends openly call him out for his misanthropy, yet they never abandon him. On Nathan For You, small business owners almost never adopt Fielder's ideas at the end of the trial. However, they almost never call him out as ridiculous. Instead, they try the idea with a healthy dose of good nature at least once, or at least enough to capture an episode's worth of material.</p><p>In this age of people screaming at each other over social media, I found this reminder of the inherent decency of people in face to face situations comforting and almost reassuring. Sure, some people are unpleasant both online and in person, and some people are pleasant in person and white supremacists in private.</p><p>But some people try to see the best in each other, give others the benefit of the doubt, and on such bonds a civil society are maintained. That this piece of high concept art could not fence in the humanity and real emotion of all the people participating, not even that of Fielder, is a bit of pleasure in this age of eye-rolling cynicism.</p><p>[Of course, these small business owners are aware a camera is on them, so the Heisenberg Principle of reality television applies. That a show like this, which depend on the subjects not knowing about the show, lasted four full seasons is a good reminder of how little-watched most cultural products are in this age of infinite content.]</p><p>BONUS CONTENT NO ONE ASKED FOR: Here is my Nathan for You idea: you know how headline stand-up comedians don't come on stage to perform until several lesser known and usually much lousier comics are trotted out to warm up the crowd? How, if you attend the live studio taping of a late night talk show like The Daily Show or The Tonight Show, some cheesy comic comes out beforehand to get your laugh muscles loose, your vocal chords primed? And when the headliner finally arrives, it comes as sweet relief?</p><p>What if there were an online dating service that provided such a warm-up buffoon for you? That is, when you go on a date, before meeting your date, first the service sends in a stand-in who is dull, awkward, a turn off in every way possible? But a few minutes into what seems to be a disastrous date, you suddenly show up and rescue the proceedings?</p><p>It sounds ridiculous, but this is just the sort of idea that Nathan for You would seem to go for. I haven't watched seasons 3 and 4 yet, so if he does end up trying this idea in one of those later episodes, please don't spoil it for me. I won't even be mad that my idea was not an original one, I'll be so happy to see actual footage of it in the field.</p><p>5. <a href=\"http://vashivisuals.com/the-hot-new-filmmaking-aspect-ratio/\" target=\"_blank\">The aspect ratio of 2:00 to 1 is everywhere</a></p><p>I first read the case for 2:00 to 1 as an aspect ratio when legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro <a href=\"http://vittoriostoraro-asc.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-is-univisium.html\" target=\"_blank\">advocated</a> for it several years ago. He anticipated a world where most movies would have a longer life viewed on screens at home than in movie theaters, and 2:00 to 1, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univisium\" target=\"_blank\">Univisium</a>, is halfway between the typical 16:9 HDTV aspect ratio and Panavision, or 2:35 to 1.</p><p>So many movies and shows use 2:00 to 1 now, and I really prefer it to 16:9 for most work.</p><p>6. <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1897/\" target=\"_blank\">Tuning AIs through captchas</a></p><p>Most everyone has probably encountered the new popular captcha which <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xnbQCBdYxuc/sddefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">displays a grid of photos and asks you to identify which contain a photo of a store front</a>. I just experienced it recently signing up for HQTrivia. This breed of captcha succeeds the wave of captchas that showed photos of short strings of text or numbers and asked you to type in what you saw, helping to train AIs trying to learn to read them. There are variants of the store front captcha: some ask you to identify vehicles, others to identify street signs, but the speculation is that Google uses these to train the \"vision\" of its self-driving cars.</p><p>AI feels like magic when it works, but underrated is the slow slog to take many AI's from stupid to competent. It's no different than training a human. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to being presented with the captcha that shows two photos, one of a really obese man, the other of five school children, with this question above them: <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/the-trolley-dilemma-would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-57111\" target=\"_blank\">\"If you had to run over and kill the people in one of these photos, which would you choose?\"</a></p><p>7.

Recovery is the most important part of training! And sleep is the most important part of recovery! And to be a champion, you need a steadfast loyalty to even the tiniest and most mundane points. Mikaela will nap on the side of the hill. She will nap at the start of the race. She will wake up in the morning, she tells me after the gym, at her house, while eating some pre-nap pasta, “and the first thought I’ll have is: I cannot wait for my nap today. I don’t care what else happens. I can’t wait to get back in bed.”<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>Mikaela also will not stay up late, and sometimes she won’t do things in the after­noon, and occasionally this leads to more people flipping out. Most of the time, she trains apart from the rest of the U.S. Ski Team and lives at home with her parents in Vail (during the nine weeks a year she’s not traveling). In the summers, she spends a few weeks in Park City, Utah, training with her teammates at the <a href=\"https://usskiandsnowboard.org/about/center-excellence\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Ski and Snowboard Center of Excellence</a>. The dynamic there is, uh, complicated. “Some sports,” Mikaela says, “you see some athletes just walking around the gym, not really doing anything, eating food. They’re first to the lunchroom, never lifting weights.”<br /> </blockquote><p>By chance, I happened to be reading <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2k21SvM\" target=\"_blank\">The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills</a> by Daniel Coyle, and had just read tips that sounded very familiar to what was mentioned here.</p><p>More echoes of Coyle's book in The New Yorker profile:</p><blockquote>My presumption was that her excellence was innate. One sometimes thinks of prodigies as embodiments of peculiar genius, uncorrupted by convention, impossible to replicate or reëngineer. But this is not the case with Shiffrin. She’s as stark an example of nurture over nature, of work over talent, as anyone in the world of sports. Her parents committed early on to an incremental process, and clung stubbornly to it. And so Shiffrin became something besides a World Cup hot shot and a quadrennial idol. She became a case study. Most parents, unwittingly or not, present their way of raising kids as the best way, even when the results are mixed, as such results usually are. The Shiffrins are not shy about projecting their example onto the world, but it’s hard to argue with their findings. “The kids with raw athletic talent rarely make it,” Jeff Shiffrin, Mikaela’s father, told me. “What was it Churchill said? Kites fly higher against a headwind.”<br /> </blockquote><p>So it wasn't a real surprise to finally read this:</p><blockquote>The Shiffrins were disciples of the ten-thousand-hours concept; the 2009 Daniel Coyle book “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/055380684X/?tag=thneyo0f-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Talent Code</a>” was scripture. They studied the training methods of the Austrians, Alpine skiing’s priesthood. The Shiffrins wanted to wring as much training as possible out of every minute of the day and every vertical foot of the course. They favored deliberate practice over competition. They considered race days an onerous waste: all the travel, the waiting around, and the emotional stress for two quick runs. They insisted that Shiffrin practice honing her turns even when just skiing from the bottom of the racecourse to the chairlift. Most racers bomb straight down, their nonchalance a badge of honor.<br /> </blockquote><p>Coyle's <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2k21SvM\" target=\"_blank\">book</a>, which I love for its succinct style (it could almost be a tweetstorm if Twitter had slightly longer character limits, each tip is averages one or two paragraphs long), is the books I recommend to all parents who want their kids to be really great at something, and not just sports.</p><p>Much of the book is about the importance of practice, and what types of practice are particularly efficient and effective.</p><blockquote>Jeff Shiffrin said, “One of the things I learned from the Austrians is: every turn you make, do it right. Don’t get lazy, don’t goof off. Don’t waste any time. If you do, you’ll be retired from racing by the time you get to ten thousand hours.”<br /> </blockquote><blockquote>“Here’s the thing,” Mikaela told me one day. “You can’t get ten thousand hours of skiing. You spend so much time on the chairlift. My coach did a calculation of how many hours I’ve been on snow. We’d been overestimating. I think we came up with something like eleven total hours of skiing on snow a year. It’s like seven minutes a day. Still, at the age of twenty-two, I’ve probably had more time on snow than most. I always practice, even on the cat tracks or in those interstitial periods. My dad says, ‘Even when you’re just stopping, be sure to do it right, maintaining a good position, with counter-rotational force.’ These are the kinds of things my dad says, and I’m, like, ‘Shut up.’ But if you say it’s seven minutes a day, then consider that thirty seconds that all the others spend just straight-lining from the bottom of the racecourse to the bottom of the lift: I use that part to work on my turns. I’m getting extra minutes. If I don’t, my mom or my coaches will stop me and say something.”<br /> </blockquote><p>Bill Simmons recently hosted Steve Kerr for a <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/2017/11/29/16717292/steve-kerr-mailbag-podcast-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">mailbag podcast</a>, and part I is fun to hear Kerr tell stories about Michael Jordan. Like so many greats, Jordan understood that the contest is won in the sweat leading up to the contest, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/chicago/columns/story?columnist=isaacson_melissa&amp;id=4463664\" target=\"_blank\">his legendary competitiveness elevated every practice and scrimmage into gladiatorial combat</a>. As Kerr noted, Jordan single-handedly was a cure for complacency for the Bulls.&nbsp;</p><p>He famously broke down some teammates with such intensity in practice that they were driven from the league entirely (remember Rodney McCray?). Everyone knows he once punched Steve Kerr and left him with a shiner during a heated practice. <a href=\"https://www.si.com/more-sports/2012/07/24/usa-basketball-game-nobody-saw\" target=\"_blank\">The Dream Team scrimmage during the lead in to the 1992 Olympics</a>, in which the coaches made Michael Jordan one captain, Magic Johnson the other, is perhaps the single sporting event I most wish had taken place in the age of smartphones and social media.</p><p>What struck me about the Shiffrin profiles, something Coyle notes about the greats, is how many of the lives of the great ones are unusually solitary, spent in deliberate practice on their own, apart from teammates. It's obviously amplified for individual sports like tennis and skiing and golf, but even for team sports, the great ones have their own routines. Not only is it lonely at the top, it's often lonely on the way there.</p><p>8. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171120-the-secret-tricks-hidden-inside-restaurant-menus\" target=\"_blank\">The secret tricks hidden inside restaurant menus</a></p><p>Perhaps because I live in the Bay Area, it feels as if the current obsession is with the dark design patterns and effects of social apps. But in the scheme of things, many other fields whose work we interact with daily have many more years of experience designing to human nature. In many ways, people designing social media have a very naive and incomplete view of human nature, but the power of the distribution of ubiquitous smartphone and network effects have elevated them to the forefront of the conversation.</p><p>Take a place like Las Vegas. Its entire existence is testament to the fact that the house always wins, yet it could not exist if it could not convince the next sucker to sit down at the table and see the next hand. The decades of research into how best to part a sucker from his wallet makes the volume of research among social media companies look like a joke, even if the latter isn't trivial.</p><p>I have a sense that social media companies are similar to where restaurants are with menu design. Every time I sit down at a new restaurant, I love examining the menus and puzzling over all the choices with fellow diners, as if having to sit with me over a meal isn't punishment enough. When the waiter comes and I ask for an overview of the menu, and recommendations, I'm wondering what dishes the entire experience is meant to nudge me to order.</p><p>I'm awaiting the advent of digital and eventually holographic or A/R menus to see what experiments we'll see. When will we have menus that are personalized? Based on what you've enjoyed here and other restaurants, we think you'll love this dish. When will we see menus that use algorithmic sorting—these are the most ordered dishes all-time, this week, today? People who ordered this also ordered this? When will see editorial endorsements? \"Pete Wells said of this dish in his NYTimes review...\"</p><p>Not all movies are worth deep study because not all movies are directed with intent. The same applies to menus, but today,&nbsp;enough menus are put through a deliberate design process that it's usually a worthwhile exercise to put them under the magnifying glass. I would love to read some blog that just analyzes various restaurant menus, so if someone starts one, please let me know.</p><p>9.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/1/16724792/hq-trivia-cheating-bots\" target=\"_blank\">Threat of bots and cheating looms as HQ Trivia reaches new popularity heights</a></p><p>When I first checked out HQ Trivia, an iOS live video streaming trivia competition for cash prizes, the number of concurrent viewers playing, displayed on the upper left of the screen, numbered in the hundreds. Now the most popular of games, which occur twice a day, attract over 250K players. In this age where we've seen empires built on exploiting the efficiencies to be gained from shifting so much of social intimacy to asynchronous channels, it's fun to be reminded of the unique fun of synchronous entertainment.</p><p>What intrigues me is not how HQ Trivia will make money. The free-to-play game industry is one of the most savvy when it comes to extracting revenue, and even something like podcasts points the way to monetizing popular media with sponsorships, product placement, etc.</p><p>What's far more interesting is where the shoulder on the S-curve is. Trivia is a game of skill, and with that comes two longstanding issues. I've answered, at most, 9 questions in a row, and it takes 12 consecutive right answers to win a share of the cash pot. I'm like most people in probably never being able to win any cash.</p><p>This is an issue faced by Daily Fantasy Sports, where the word \"fantasy\" is the most important word. Very soon after they became popular, DFS were overrun by sharks submitting hundreds or thousands of lineups with the aid of computer programs, and some of those sharks worked for the companies themselves. The \"fantasy\" being sold is that the average person has a chance of winning.</p><p>As noted above in my comment about Las Vegas, it's not impossible to sell people on that dream. The most beautiful of cons is one the mark willingly participates in. People participate in negative expected value activities all the time, like the lottery, and carnival games, and often they're aware they'll lose. Some people just participate for the fun of it, and a free-to-play trivia game costs a player nothing other than some time, even if the expected value is close to zero.</p><p>A few people have asked me whether that live player count is real, and I'm actually more intrigued by the idea it isn't. Fake it til you make it is one of the most popular refrains of not just Silicon Valley but entrepreneurs everywhere. What if HQ Trivia just posted a phony live player count of 1 million tomorrow? Would their growth accelerate even more than it has recently?&nbsp;What about 10 million? When does the marginal return to every additional player in that count go negative because people feel that there is so much competition it's not worth it? Or is the promise of possibly winning money besides the point? What if the pot scaled commensurate to the number of players; would it become like the lottery? Massive pots but long odds?</p><p>The other problem, linked to the element of skill, is cheating. As noted in the article linked above, and in this <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/12/people-are-googling-the-answers-to-hq-trivia-app-questions.html?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=s3&amp;utm_campaign=sharebutton-t\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> about the spike in Google searches for answers during each of the twice-a-day games, cheating is always a concern in games, especially as the monetary rewards increase. I played the first game when HQ Trivia had a $7,500 cash pot, and the winners each pocketed something like $575 and change. Not a bad payout for something like 10 minutes of fun.</p><p>Online poker, daily fantasy sports, all are in constant battle with bots and computer-generated entries. Even sports books at casinos have to wage battle with sharks who try to get around betting caps by sending in all sorts of confederates to put down wagers on their behalf.</p><p>I suspect both of these issues will be dampeners on the game's prospects, but more so the issue of skill. I already find myself passing on games when I'm not with others who also play or who I can rope into playing with me. That may be the game's real value, inspiring communal bonding twice a day among people in the same room.</p><p>People like to quip that pornography is the tip of the spear when it comes to driving adoption of new technologies, but I'm partial to trivia. It is so elemental and pure a game, with such comically self-explanatory rules, that it is one of the elemental forms or genres of gaming, just like HQ Trivia host Scott Rogowsky is some paragon of a game-show host, mixing just the right balance of cheesiness and snarkiness and effusiveness needed to convince all the players that any additional irony would be unseemly.</p><p>10. <a href=\"https://story.californiasunday.com/raising-a-teenage-daughter\" target=\"_blank\">Raising a teenage daughter</a></p><p>Speaking of Elizabeth Weil, who wrote the Shiffrin profile for Outside, here's another of her pieces, a profile of her daughter Hannah. The twist is that the piece includes annotations by Hannah after the fact.</p><p>It is a delight. The form is perfect for revealing the dimensions of their relationship, and that of mothers and teenage daughters everywhere. In the interplay of their words, we sense truer contours of their love, shaped, as they are, by two sets of hands.</p><p>[Note, Esquire has long published annotated profiles,&nbsp;you can Google for them, but they are now all locked behind a paywall]</p><p>This format makes me question how many more profiles would benefit from allowing the subject of a piece to annotate after the fact. It reveals so much about the limitations of understanding between two people, the unwitting and witting lies at the heart of journalism, and what Janet Malcolm meant, when she wrote, in the classic opening paragraph of her book <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2klqr7f\" target=\"_blank\">The Journalist and the Murderer</a>, \"Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.\"</p>~\n"

To build “better moderation tools for Twitter” (mentioned at 24:05), wouldn’t hardest parts be (1) chicken &amp; egg problem of getting users and (2) scaling backend to millions of users?

No matter how many weak value props you list, they don’t add up to a strong value prop; they’re only as strong as the strongest one in the list. His list is:</p><ul><li>A better DMs system in Twitter</li><li>More social moderation tools</li><li>A reply system with threads</li><li>Better ways to track reputation</li><li>Deploy without server administration work</li></ul><p>If we pick one value prop from the list, e.g. “a better DMs system in Twitter”… well, what are we even talking about? How is it a better DMs system? I guess because it’s peer to peer and people control their data… but now we’re talking in abstractions. We’ve gotten too far removed from a specific description of how a specific person’s life is getting better before vs. after.</p><p>Right now, if I didn’t want Twitter to see my messages, then I’d just use a platform that end-to-end encrypts messages. And maybe one day Twitter itself will add an option to end-to-end encrypt DMs. It’s so weak to just answer my question by saying “a better DMs system in Twitter”. It only looks like it might be an awesome answer because it’s followed up by a bunch of other things in a list, that together make you think about a big abstract vision of a “better web”, or something. This kind of abstraction trap is why I insist that a <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">Value Prop Story</a> must be a highly specific story, not merely an abstract story.</p><p>Paul was interviewed on the <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dwarkeshpatel/episodes/3-Paul-Frazee-Creator-of-BeakerBrowser---Building-the-Future-of-the-Web-efbiib\">Lunar Society Podcast</a> a few months ago (June 2020) and the discussion turned to what’s a killer app for Beaker Browser. This excerpt from 16:45 is revealing:</p><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/496a4651c25b405c3a60b31e61dfba02/href\">https://medium.com/media/496a4651c25b405c3a60b31e61dfba02/href</a><blockquote><strong><em>Interviewer:</em></strong><em> Are you guys thinking about applications that could be built on this protocol, using this new paradigm, that just can’t exist in the existing ways of thinking?</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Paul:</em></strong><em> Yeah, you’re also touching on what a lot of people talk about, which is the “killer app” question. In my opinion, especially in the early lifecycle of this, the killer app is the hackability. There are a lot of developers out there who like being able to do this sort of thing. The ease with which we can both take existing code and change it, or just create a new application and put it out into the world, has never been matched in my opinion whenever you use a technology like this.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>And this connects to the fact that when you do it this way, you also get rid of what you call “dev ops” in the tech industry, which is the process of setting up and maintaining and then paying for a server. Well a peer-to-peer system is designed to more or less handle scale automatically. As more people get involved, they share bandwidth. So as someone is publishing the software, you’re able to put the software out there without having to think about it anymore.</em></blockquote><p>If the differentiator is the ease of putting a new application out into the world, that value prop is competing against the value prop of e.g. today’s full-stack web frameworks, right? If that were true, then there should be some kind of demo or proof of that, like Beaker Browser competing with other frameworks in ease of building <a href=\"http://todomvc.com/\">TodoMVC</a>. Or is it competing against the value of easy-to-use hosting platforms like <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com\">Firebase</a>? Again, no head-to-head demo proving superiority.</p><p>It seems they’d rather not stoop to naming and validating a specific killer app. They’d rather keep thinking of Beaker Browser as a big abstract ball of irreducible awesomeness.</p><h3>Yet another developer platform bloated MVP</h3><p>This Bloated MVP is structurally very similar to another one I’ve written about: <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/axiom-org-mvp-review-blockchain-more-like-bloatchain-4e4ef248162c\">Axiom</a>. Like the Axiom team, the Beaker team doesn’t have a clue what Beaker’s killer app could plausibly be, but they think they’ve found an escape into a level of indirection by saying “developers will love it and build a killer app”. But what killer app might the developers plausibly build?</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/390/0*kzNZuoHMruHbOD5X.png\" /></figure><p>Stop hiding behind your level of indirection and think about the whole value chain.

      "<h4>The evolutionary leap that only a small fraction of startups manage to make</h4><p>In pondering the Fermi paradox, the confusing fact that humans seem to be the only intelligent life in the observable universe, a popular theory first published by Robin Hanson asserts the existence of an evolutionary leap that’s extremely rare for any species to make. The “Great Filter” is Hanson’s term for this species-killing leap. Check out <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\">WaitButWhy</a>’s explanation for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fHwZu7Xv6KuKAXOi.png\" /></figure><p>Let’s talk about another Great Filter: the Great Filter of Startups. It’s the evolutionary leap that only a small fraction of <em>startups</em> manage to make. Do you know what I’m referring to?</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>The Great Filter of Startups is <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/your-mvp-is-bloated-3e89131b3cb\">having zero users</a> because you never create value for a single user.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qg4WS08YxCUM1KM49pFlSA.png\" /></figure><p>In my observation, about 80% of startups are killed by the Great Filter before they ever got one user. I find this shockingly wasteful.</p><p>People don’t realize that most startups’ fate is already sealed in their idea phase: they never have a well-formed <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">value prop story</a>.</p><p>I’m constantly watching startups with incoherent value prop stories predictably die in a super pathetic way: Not by being unprofitable, not by being outcompeted… just by living in their own isolated world and never building a bridge to one single outside person outside of the startup. By never having anyone outside the startup care that they exist.</p><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/88f95b58519f80804ad8907922c3e5d9/href\">https://medium.com/media/88f95b58519f80804ad8907922c3e5d9/href</a><p>The reason I write this blog is because I constantly see brilliant founders investing so much time and money on a project, in seemingly complete ignorance about Great Filter of Startups. To me, they look like a truck driving full speed ahead toward the same concrete wall that 80% of other startups before them have crashed into.</p><p>But hey, startups are supposed to hard, right? Yes… but getting the first user isn’t supposed to be the hard part! Getting one user really shouldn’t be the Great Filter that it is.</p><p>Right now, the problem is just that most founders don’t make it their explicit goal to get one user. They don’t have the awareness of the Great Filter looming in front of them. They’re driving the truck into the wall because <em>they aren’t aware of the wall</em>.</p><p>Once more founders learn about the Great Filter, they’ll learn the <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-lean-mvp-flowchart-add48d7bcbae\">best practices</a> for routing around it, and it’ll stop killing 80% of startups.

      "<p>So I watched <a href=\"https://www.generalmagicthemovie.com/\">the movie</a> about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Magic\">General Magic</a> and I figure it’s up my alley to analyze how this train wreck happened.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SiUmE9FFDo39EUpVf2bylQ.png\" /></figure><p>If you haven’t heard the story: Two of the original Apple geniuses, Bill Atkinson and Andy Hertzeld, plus a charismatic business guy named Marc Porat, left Apple in 1990 to start General Magic, a spinoff company making an iPhone-like device using the janky technology of the time. (For context, the first iPhone launched in 2007 and was groundbreaking technology for <em>its</em> time.)</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/103/0*GjIiNvAIelbDsnR7.png\" /></figure><p>After over four years of R&amp;D, they partnered with Sony to launch Magic Link, an early Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), and got basically <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/your-mvp-is-bloated-3e89131b3cb\">zero users</a>. One of the General Magic employees in the movie was saying how he recognized all the names in the list of Magic Link buyers. They were all just friends of the project. No one else ever got the value prop or cared.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/0*DCGnQizMZqxSfaDM\" /></figure><p>They even got their ass kicked by the Apple Newton, which launched earlier (1993) and sold a hundred times more devices than General Magic ever did, and the Newton is <em>itself</em> an infamous $100M market failure due to its high price and bad handwriting recognition.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*P2cx-XuF8SDB_KRv\" /></figure><p>In 1995, General Magic IPO’d and raised $96M, plus another $200M from strategic partners.</p><p>The movie made it seem like the IPO marked the peak of a hype wave which deflated once Magic Link launched, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Magic\">Wikipedia’s timeline</a> looks more complicated. Somehow the wildly successful IPO happened after Magic Link — I guess it was before Magic Link’s dismal sales were widely known? — and then they chugged along for another five years, sans the original team, before shutting down.</p><h3>How did it happen?</h3><p>Imagine: You’re standing on the beach, squinting to see into the distant waters. You think you can see the greatest wave of all time start to gather momentum: Mobile computing. Oh, and also the other biggest wave of all time, digital connectivity (too early to definitively say “the internet”).</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*55lEGSdosmCjuZAZ\" /></figure><p>If this once-in-a-lifetime wave is really coming, doesn’t it make sense to go all out to ride it?</p><p>Ok, but when you’re trying to ride a wave, you have to come at it from the optimal angle. If you just charge at it straight on, you get dunked underwater and you’re struggling to breathe, because you’re actually trying to boil the ocean. (I have no idea what surfing is like ok?)</p><p>What I mean is this:</p><p>At first glance, General Magic had an amazing <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">Value Prop Story</a>: A cell phone that also had a calculator, contact list, spreadsheets, email, etc.</p><p>But in order to have a strong Value Prop Story, you have to be a lot better than the next-best alternative, and that was where the pitch starts to get weaker. In 1990, the next-best alternative for all of those functions was a laptop and a “dumb” cellphone. That alternative was good enough for most people’s needs. Plus, making a portable computing device really good at any one function was painstakingly hard.</p><p>If we imagine that General Magic is going to use its R&amp;D superpowers to make a mobile device that’s so functional easy to use that most people prefer it to a laptop (as they do with modern smartphones), then we’re back to having a strong Value Prop Story.</p><p>Most bloated MVPs I cover on this blog are ones where the value prop is just not that attractive to the market (compared to already existing alternatives), regardless of future technological progress. This is the first time I’m writing about a technologically-ahead-of-its-time Bloated MVP.</p><p>General Magic is interesting because in some hypothetical sense they had a plausible path to making a great product, but in a real sense they didn’t, because the only path was a ten-year R&amp;D path. The consumer technology industry moves fast enough that a ten-year path to release a product is fundamentally a hopeless business strategy. A small team can’t work really hard on a revolutionary device if it takes more than a couple years.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/612/0*iP6Xoat4nQ-1ejR8.jpg\" /><figcaption>If you embark on a long path, the sun may set before your journey is complete. —Chinese proverb</figcaption></figure><p>The movie highlights this problem by talking about how while the Internet and the World Wide Web were becoming increasingly mainstream in the ‘90s, the Magic Link team wasn’t paying attention, instead developing their networking capabilities to work on a proprietary AT&amp;T-only network called “PersonaLink”. Their MVP was obsolete when they shipped it — and that was only after four years of R&amp;D, before they could even ship something anything near as good as their original hopes.</p><p>The General Magic folks were uncalibrated about what successfully riding a market trend looks like. Contrast Steve Jobs’s famously market-calibrated senses when he came back to Apple and launched the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad (although Jobs was less calibrated about building for the market during most of his tenure at NeXT).</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c0517f53cba3\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/general-magic-mvp-review-surfing-a-wave-or-boiling-the-ocean-c0517f53cba3\">General Magic MVP Review: Surfing a wave, or boiling the ocean?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp\">Bloated MVP</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://hey.com\">Hey</a> is an email service developed by Basecamp and launched in June 2020. Within 10 days of launching into public beta, they reportedly made their first $1M in revenue by selling over 10,000 subscriptions at $99/yr.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UJPiTRL9KKppB8kfg3WMuQ.png\" /></figure><p>Hey has an opinionated view on what are the most common workflows that people use email for, and builds those workflows as first-class product features.</p><p>They do a good job showcasing these features on their <a href=\"https://hey.com/how-it-works/\">How It Works</a> page:</p><ul><li><strong>The Screener:</strong> When anyone emails you for the first time, you have to opt-in to seeing their emails</li><li><strong>The Feed:</strong> You designate which email addresses send you content that’s more like an article in a newsfeed than a 2-way email communication, and then you get a separate UI tab for those emails that’s more like an RSS feed reader</li><li><strong>The Paper Trail:</strong> You designate which email addresses send you receipts, and then there’s a tab for those</li><li><strong>The Imbox:</strong> A portmanteau of “important” and “inbox” (itself a closed compound of “in” and “box”). Everything that isn’t screened out by the Screener or routed to the Feed or Paper Trail is considered important.</li><li><strong>Reply Later:</strong> A separate queue for emails you plan to return to later</li><li><strong>Focus &amp; Reply Mode:</strong> A streamlined UX for your “reply later” workflow</li><li><strong>Files View:</strong> A grid view of all the attachments you’ve received</li><li><strong>Editable Thread Subject Line: </strong>Helps you organize your Imbox</li><li><strong>Thread Merging:</strong> You can manually merge two message threads into one</li><li><strong>Customizable notification rules</strong></li><li><strong>Blocks Trackers:</strong> Hey gives you privacy by not loading the pixels that tell senders’ servers that you viewed an email</li></ul><h3>What’s the Value Prop Story?</h3><p>Does this large set of features add up to a compelling <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">Value Prop Story</a>?</p><p>Hey’s value prop is that it lets you process your emails faster and with less mental effort than Gmail (or whatever other email service). The answer to “when in your life you’d actually use it”, normally a big part of the challenge of telling a value prop story, is obvious in this case: You use it whenever you’re using Gmail now.</p><p>But when you’re trying to displace a mature product like Gmail, the problem is that you have to pour a lot of effort into your MVP before you can launch it, which leads to launching with a bunch of features, as listed above.</p><h3>Why it *doesn’t* have too many features</h3><p>A common failure mode for MVPs is trying to combine a bunch of features into an unfocused product, in hopes of making the whole more than the sum of its parts.</p><p>Item #4 in my <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-bloated-mvp-test-1f5b0770305f\">Bloated MVP Test</a> explains why it’s normally a red flag to bundle multiple use cases into one MVP: It’s because you don’t know if anyone gives a crap about <em>any</em> feature, so you should just focus on the smallest subset of features necessary to get your first signal of market validation.</p><p>But in Hey’s case, they get a pass for a couple reasons.</p><p>First, they get a pass because an email service must consist of multiple sub-workflows. Hey must be able to do all the most common tasks that most people do with email, or else the good parts could easily be outweighed by the bad parts.</p><p>Consider speed as a value prop. Hey feels faster than Gmail. But in order to achieve this, they have to build multiple speed optimizations: make the page’s initial load go faster, make clicking on an email thread go faster, make marking an email as unread go, make pulling up your Feed faster, etc. If any part doesn’t go faster, it undermines the appeal of Hey being faster than Gmail.</p><p>Second, they get a pass because the public beta we’re seeing isn’t the real MVP. The definition of an MVP is <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-lean-mvp-flowchart-add48d7bcbae\">something that gives someone value</a>. According to Basecamp cofounder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1225488200405278721\">DHH</a>, a more bare-bones version of Hey was giving value to him well before their public beta. <em>That</em> was the real MVP.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*vxxzYS4EMB2KnpyL.gif\" /></figure><p>In the earliest days, when Hey was still a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@lironshapira/half-baked-products-and-idea-kernels-d30f197ae671\">half-baked kernel</a> and they were playing with the idea of splitting an email inbox into the Imbox, Feed, and Paper Trail, they probably just prototyped the idea by setting up Gmail labels and filters for those three buckets, and testing if that made their personal email incrementally better.</p><p>They also conducted a bit of market testing for their other feature ideas. In 2019, early in Hey’s development, DHH was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1146670866949967873\">tweeting</a> about how email tracking pixels are an unacceptable violation of privacy, and he got a strong polarized reaction which surely egged him on, I mean provided validation for the idea.</p><p>So, in a pretty short amount of time (less than a year) they had lean MVPs good enough to dogfood internally, while collecting evidence of market validation. Not too shabby.</p><h3>Is it bloated?</h3><p>While Hey does have a few surface signs of bloatedness:</p><ul><li>It’s a Whole Product complete with all the features listed above. This breaks rule #3 on the <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-bloated-mvp-test-1f5b0770305f\">Bloated MVP test</a>.</li><li>The team spent about 18 months on it, and probably had something like 8 full-time staff working on it, which is about 12 person-years or $4M. This breaks rule #5 on the Bloated MVP test.</li><li>They wrote code, lots of it. This breaks rule #6 on the Bloated MVP test.</li></ul><p>They only score 3/10 on the Bloated MVP Test overall. That’s very much a Lean MVP. (I would never expect anyone to score 0/10. Startups don’t perfectly follow every rule of thumb!)</p><p>I have to say, it’s rare and impressive to see a product launch with tons of publicity, make $1M in ten days (and $3–10M/yr recurring revenue by end of 2020 if I had to guess), and still manage to be a Lean MVP. The Basecamp team is a talented bunch.</p><p>I’ve been using the product myself. I like it a bit better than Gmail for my personal email because:</p><ul><li><strong>It’s faster.</strong> That’s an unfair comparison because my Gmail has to deal with a 16-year backlog of my emails, but still, being faster is really nice.</li><li><strong>It’s calmer.</strong> For example, I can forget to check my Feed for a few days, and only pay attention to my Imbox. This way, I save time and attention because I’m not distracted by random feed content in the middle of my day.</li></ul><p>Designer Jonas Downey explains on <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-achieve-simple-design-for-basecamp-and-hey/\">Basecamp’s blog</a> how they intentionally made Hey more calm/respectful/peaceful compared to other email software, and compared to for-profit software more generally:</p><blockquote>At a high level it boils down to a handful of foundational principles that affect the decisions we make:<br />[…]<br />3. Prioritizing respectful interfaces that don’t overwhelm or try to nag the user into certain behaviors. We intentionally don’t include things like notification counts/badges, 3-column designs, and such unless we absolutely can’t avoid them. We don’t like the idea of having “sticky” interfaces — we want our customers to use our products to get the job done, and then go do something else. That makes the whole design approach more peaceful in general.</blockquote><p>It’s a good principle with good execution.</p><p>Lastly, I’ll leave you with this proof that Hey isn’t bloated:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/946/0*fMVTikG3vCfhqUrf\" /></figure><p>Ok, looks like there’s no way to pull up a list of recent emails I’ve sent 😂</p><p>It’s incredibly daring that they decided “Sent folder” wasn’t a must-have for their MVP release, while at the same time pouring lots of love on less traditional features like giving “spy trackers” the finger.</p><p>We can learn a few lessons from Hey: Dare to be opinionated. Dare to be principled. And most of all, dare to be lean.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b2f26eab729b\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/hey-com-mvp-review-they-really-know-what-theyre-doing-mvp-wise-b2f26eab729b\">Hey.com MVP Review: They Really Know What They’re Doing MVP-Wise</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp\">Bloated MVP</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n",

      "<p><a href=\"https://openland.com/\">OpenLand</a> (YC W18) was founded in 2017 and launched their private beta in mid 2019. That’s when I first tried it out, but I waited for them to launch publicly this year to write my MVP review. And here we are.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SaZvtS44ePTvDHPiubwc3g.png\" /></figure><p>Their product is basically Slack except with no organizations, just channels and users. It’s impressively modern-looking and feature-rich for an MVP.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ShFkPXMg-YTbhfq-OL7eDQ.png\" /></figure><p>So, what’s the value prop and why is it better than Slack?</p><p>From the <a href=\"https://openland.com/about\">about page</a>:</p><blockquote>Openland is a new messenger for high-quality communities. Its communities are small, moderated, and are based on shared values. In premium communities, members are asked to pay a small monthly subscription to ensure active participation and to compensate organizers’ work. Community experience is centered around conversations with experts, building community knowledge, sharing experiences among members, and starting new meaningful relationships. Openland has beautiful, ultra-fast apps for all desktop and mobile platforms.</blockquote><p>Apparently, if you’re the organizer of a “small” community (I’m guessing this means roughly 10–500 members), Openland wants to convince you that it’s the best chat platform to use.</p><p>Ok, “organizer of a small community” is a reasonable target market. Not super specific, but not super vague either. What’s an example of such an organizer and such a community? The “featured communities” section on the home page provides four examples:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_hF3OAG5zatORXVPi8r6Uw.png\" /></figure><p>Let’s check them out. Here’s the biggest one, Fundraising Help:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Rtxlx125M0YMrM-f6yyl_w.png\" /></figure><p>There’s not much activity happening in this community. I checked out the other three featured communities, and they have less activity than this one.</p><p>If Openland is the best place for communities, why can’t I find a single active community?</p><p>It’s striking to contrast the underwhelming state of their communities with their overwhelming success at cloning Slack: complete with reactions, stickers, link previews, formatting, editing, drafts, mentions, replies, forwards, threaded comments, conference calls, native apps for all platforms, dark mode and color themes.</p><p>It’s all too common to see startups spending their runway chasing the siren song of product and engineering craftsmanship, only to crash against the jagged rocks of market irrelevance. Openland looks to me like a classic case of ignoring your huge market risk and just focusing on the non-risky areas of product and engineering. It’s a nice flow state while it lasts.</p><p>What’s the bull case for the idea? Is it plausible that they’ll find some communities to use it?</p><p>I’m just not clear on what specific use case makes this differentiated from Slack, Discord, Facebook groups, Whatsapp groups, etc. They mention letting you charge your group members a subscription fee, but the alternative of setting up a Substack or Patreon or Locals.com or other membership service that bills your community members for you isn’t hard.</p><p>In order to understand Openland’s value prop, we need to see <em>one community</em> that is thriving on Openland, and understand why that community couldn’t thrive equally well on an existing platform. One <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">value prop story</a>.</p><p>Without a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XosKB3mkvmXMZ3fBQ/specificity-your-brain-s-superpower\">specific</a> value prop story, is there at least an abstract argument why Openland’s platform fills a gap in the market? Maybe there’s some kind of virality or network effect where being a platform for N communities would put them in a stronger position to be a platform for N+1 communities. But I don’t really see it. It seems like their structural difference of having organization-less channels doesn’t much affect whether people are interested in another Slack-like product.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-bloated-mvp-test-1f5b0770305f\">Bloated MVP Test</a> Score: 8/10</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=61ff9ed4c367\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/openland-yc-w18-mvp-review-chasing-the-siren-song-of-product-and-engineering-craftsmanship-61ff9ed4c367\">Openland (YC W18) MVP Review: Chasing the siren song of product and engineering craftsmanship</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp\">Bloated MVP</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n",

      "<h4>How to tell if you’ve just wasted your life on a bloated MVP</h4><p>Most early-stage startups fall into the trap of making a <a href=\"https://bloatedmvp.com\">bloated MVP</a> which nets them <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/your-mvp-is-bloated-3e89131b3cb\">zero users</a> for their effort. Here’s a handy 10-question test to let you know if <em>your </em>startup is one of these rampant bloated MVPs. Just answer each question Yes or No:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bHSRvNkxmjPZQYj3R2qctA.png\" /></figure><ol><li><strong>Hazy value prop?</strong></li><li><strong>Zero active users?</strong></li><li><strong>A whole product?</strong></li><li><strong>Bundling multiple use cases?</strong></li><li><strong>More than 3 person-months?</strong></li><li><strong>Code?</strong></li><li><strong>Wishful-thinking features?</strong></li><li><strong>Tedious user experience?</strong></li><li><strong>Brand/UI/UX flourishes?</strong></li><li><strong>Nonessential content?</strong></li></ol><p>See below for a detailed explanation of each question, and scroll to the bottom to see what your score means about your MVP.</p><h3>1. Hazy value prop?</h3><p>This question, which I call the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iMQmfgieRKY62MC3z/the-power-to-judge-startup-ideas#The_Value_Prop_Story_Test\">Value Prop Story Test</a>, is more subtle than it seems. In order to have a value prop, your idea must pass the Value Prop Story Test, which means:</p><ul><li>There’s a specific individual, who you can name, who has a certain need in their life that you’re filling</li><li>There must <em>not</em> be another way for that individual to fill that same need equally well</li><li>You must be able to give a plausible “day in the life” story about when and why that individual turns to your product or service for help, rather than doing literally anything else with that moment of their day</li></ul><p>This is question is #1 on the list because in order to answer it, you don’t have to do any actual work. It’s a purely theoretical test.</p><p>Imagine you’re sitting on the couch having a beer when a startup idea comes to you. Your idea could pass or fail the Value Prop Story Test before ever getting any customers, before writing any code, before even finishing your beer and getting off your couch. It’s the most basic <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">sanity check</a> of the possibility that your idea could ever hope to work.</p><h3>2. Zero active users?</h3><p>The most common answer to this question is “yes, because we haven’t launched yet”. That’s too bad; you should have launched by now.</p><p>The second-most-common answer is “no, we have our first 500 users!” But actually you mean “yes, we have zero active users”. Most startups who claim to have 500 users actually just have 500 people who came in to check them out for thirty seconds when they launched on Product Hunt, or 500 people who poked around for a minute when they ran app-install ads on Facebook.</p><p>An <strong>active user</strong> is a human being who gives a crap that your service exists, and if they suddenly couldn’t use your product or service, they’d call you to complain and offer you money to bring it back. Here’s a good way to count active users which makes sense for most (but not all) startups:</p><blockquote>How many users do you have who signed up more than 7 days ago, and subsequently came back and engaged with your service at least once in the last 7 days?</blockquote><h3>3. A whole product?</h3><p>The term “minimum viable product” <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-lean-mvp-flowchart-add48d7bcbae\">misleads founders</a> by its use of the word “product”. If it’s complete enough to feel like a product rather than a half-baked <em>prototype</em> or a human-powered <em>process</em>, it’s probably not a lean enough MVP.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/liron/status/1134426767572250625\">@liron</a></p></blockquote><p>A recent example of a startup whose MVP wasn’t a whole product is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/technology/clubby-silicon-valley-app-clubhouse.html\">Clubhouse</a>. The founders shared a Testflight beta of their app to friends of friends, grew to hundreds of active users, and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/05/15/andreessen-horowitz-wins-vc-sweepstakes-to-back-clubhouse-voice-app/#526a96cc6f2a\">raised $12M</a> from Andreessen Horowitz, all without ever launching their app into the app store.</p><p><a href=\"https://relationshiphero.com\">Relationship Hero</a>’s MVP wasn’t a whole product either. It was a Facebook group where my cofounder and I would give dating advice to our friends. When I took a vacation and came back and there were still active users in the group (as defined in #2 above), that was when we decided that we had enough market validation to invest a few person-weeks building the first version of RelationshipHero.com.</p><h3>4. Bundling multiple use cases?</h3><p>Many startups trick themselves into thinking they have a <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">value prop</a> because they have a unique combination of features, and they think the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. They’re wrong about that. The whole is only as great as its one strongest part. The MVP should be focused on validating the one strongest part.</p><p>I’ve previously <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/axiom-org-mvp-review-blockchain-more-like-bloatchain-4e4ef248162c\">explained</a> on this blog:</p><blockquote>If you pick one value prop hypothesis and launch the minimal thing you need to validate demand for that hypothesis, that’s a lean MVP. If you pick two or more orthogonal ones and stick them together, that’s usually a bloated MVP.</blockquote><p>Validating market demand is usually where new startups fail. You’d be lucky to validate having strong market demand for one use case. Validating market demand for multiple use cases may be doable, but don’t try to do it all with the same MVP.</p><h3>5. More than three person-months?</h3><p>Most startups waste three Person-<em>Years</em> on what they think is a reduced-scope MVP, but it’s actually a bloated MVP.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/296/1*AiG_jH9Wnv0pr72IR7pbEA.png\" /><figcaption>The Bloated MVP Flowchart</figcaption></figure><p>Ever wonder how Y Combinator is only a 3-month program, yet a large fraction of their companies are able to raise $millions on Demo Day? It’s because YC companies are taught to follow the <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/the-lean-mvp-flowchart-add48d7bcbae\">Lean MVP Flowchart</a>. In just a few weeks, these companies are able to show an impressive graph with a larger and larger quantity of value being given to real people.</p><p>If you’re sinking more than three person-months of work into your startup before you’re giving value to a single person, it’s a red flag that your MVP is bloated.</p><h3>6. Code?</h3><p>These days, if your MVP involves writing code, it’s probably a bloated MVP.</p><p>First, no-code solutions like Typeform, Shopify, Squarespace, Webflow, Facebook pages, Zapier, etc are more than good enough to help you serve your first ten users, which is all an MVP needs to do. Sure, these ten users won’t get a polished automated experience. But until you have hundreds of users, you have enough time to reach out and personally help each user have a smooth experience.</p><p>Second, your idea has low technology risk, and you shouldn’t waste time de-risking something that isn’t a high risk. Unless you’re a tech-heavy <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/when-not-to-be-a-lean-startup-8e974b28dbf4\">exception</a>, all your risk is <em>market risk</em>: the risk that no one would care enough to use your product even if it existed in a polished form.</p><p>If you’re inexperienced at building software, writing code does reduce <em>team risk</em> — the risk that your founding team might not be competent enough to ship working software. But if you’re already confident in your ability to build software (or your ability to manage contractors), there’s not much to prove or de-risk by writing code.</p><h3>7. Wishful-thinking features?</h3><p>Wishful-thinking features are features that make sense once your product has hundreds/thousands/millions of active users, but don’t add any value when the product has 0–10 users. For example:</p><ul><li>Your consumer social MVP doesn’t need a search feature for user-generated content! “But what if we get so much user-generated content that it’s completely hopeless to scroll through?” Aha, that’s wishful thinking. Don’t worry about it until it actually becomes a problem. Once it becomes a problem, congratulate yourself for having a successful MVP and getting much farther along than most startups ever get!</li><li>Your marketplace MVP doesn’t need supplier-side features! Your first 1–10 demand-side users will be getting matched to supply that you’ve manually sourced and inputted yourself.</li></ul><p>When building an MVP, you should focus all your effort on making sure the first 1–10 users receive a ton of value so that they’ll keep coming back as active users. Once you have that life-or-death milestone in your rearview mirror, you can start building features that presuppose having a larger active user base.</p><h3>8. Tedious user experience?</h3><p>A tedious user experience means you’re expecting users to do work for you, but you’re not immediately rewarding users for their effort.</p><p>For example, if you have a long signup flow with a dozen steps, you better give the user a big payoff at the end. Otherwise you’ve given them a raw deal: you took more than you gave.</p><p>You might think you’ll “pay them back later” by giving them more value when your product is more mature, but it rarely works that way. If your MVP isn’t giving users an immediate payoff for every ask you make of them, it’s probably bloated.</p><h3>9. Brand/UI/UX flourishes?</h3><p>If a product or service looks good, that’s a sign that the team has good taste. But if there are too many fancy logos, graphics, animations and other embellishments, that’s a sign of a bloated MVP.</p><p>Brand and UI/UX flourishes should come after you have active users. Investing in a fancy brand or logo before having active users is premature optimization. Until you have your first active users, you should be prepared to throw away everything you’ve built so far, and your fancy design is probably just extra stuff you’ll have to throw away.</p><p>Michael Seibel, CEO of Y Combinator, <a href=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/the-real-product-market-fit/\">paints a great picture</a> of what a lean MVP looks like:</p><blockquote>If your friend was standing next to you and their hair was on fire, that fire would be the only thing they really cared about in this world. […] If you handed them a brick they would still grab it and try to hit themselves on the head to put out the fire.</blockquote><p>You almost want to make your MVP a crude, ugly brick on purpose. If you can successfully sell a brick, you’ll get a stronger signal of market demand. If you have to polish your design just to attract your first user, it probably means you can’t find anyone who is truly desperate for what you’re building, and you’ll need to work harder to differentiate yourself in your market.</p><h3>10. Nonessential content?</h3><p>If you’re writing high-quality content to build an audience, that’s a great strategy — in fact, just building something like an email list can be your lean MVP. On the other hand, if you’re building a product and you also have a blog or social media full of mediocre posts that you think are “on brand”, that’s probably a waste of your time and a sign of a bloated MVP.</p><p>If your content isn’t on the critical path for acquiring your first 1–10 users, then don’t bother with it. Just be laser-focused on acquiring your first 1–10 users.</p><p>Count up the number of Yes answers to get your score:</p><ul><li>0–3: <strong>Lean MVP:</strong> Congratulations, your startup has the rare distinction of not being a bloated MVP! You’ve earned the right to concern yourself with next-level considerations like your unit economics and growth tactics.</li><li>4–6: <strong>Bloated MVP:</strong> Most of what you’ve been working on is a waste, and you should probably stop working on it immediately (maybe save it for later).

      "<p><a href=\"https://roamresearch.com\">Roam Research</a> launched in public beta in Oct 2019 and calls itself “a note-taking tool for networked thought”. It’s been getting a lot of praise and attention from smart people on Twitter.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2vf7qwnXa30DWH2tzuB8vQ.png\" /></figure><p>So let’s take a look. Does it have a compelling value prop, or is it a bloated MVP?</p><h3>The Zettelkasten Method</h3><p>Roam is inspired by the Zettelkasten method of note-taking. “Zettelkasten” is a German word for a box to store note cards in. The main idea of the Zettelkasten method is that instead of writing in a book of full pages, you write on tons of small rearrangeable index cards. The cards have bullets on them and use a special numbering system to enable cards to reference each other. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1\">LessWrong</a> has a good in-depth explanation.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/980/0*zw8YfThcYDrr9XDy\" /><figcaption>A Zettelkasten card, analogous to a Roam page</figcaption></figure><p>Roam’s hypothesis is that popular tools like Evernote, Google Docs and Notion are flawed for research and note-taking because they’re more like a book of pages than a pile of index cards.</p><p>Roam has two atomic building blocks: <strong>pages</strong> and <strong>bullets</strong>.</p><ul><li>A Roam page is like a Zettlekasten index card, not like a big, um, page. Maybe Roam should call these “cards” instead of “pages”.</li><li>A Roam bullet is a smallish unit of text which lives on a Roam page and can be nested in an arbitrarily deep hierarchy.</li></ul><h3>What about Workflowy?</h3><p><a href=\"https://workflowy.com\">Workflowy</a> is notable to mention because it’s built entirely out of bullets, which is similar to Roam.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/760/0*iZo4cQ9aXSO_Dy_D.png\" /></figure><p>Unlike Roam, Workflowy doesn’t have a separate concept of a “page”. Your whole Workflowy account is like one big page of bullets. If you want to make a new page, you just make a new top-level bullet instead. Then you can “zoom in” to that bullet point and it’s like you’re “on that page” seeing only its sub-bullets.</p><p>I personally use Workflowy pretty often, so I get why a bullet-based tool is quick and easy for taking notes and drafting ideas. The main question I had about Roam is how it’s incrementally better than Workflowy for my needs.</p><p>Roam’s MVP seems to already have feature parity with all of Workflowy, which is pretty impressive. (It’s not fully caught up yet on multi-user collaboration and scalability, but I’m sure it will be soon enough.)</p><p>What does Roam do that Workflowy can’t? Roam’s #1 differentiator is <strong>linking</strong>: You can easily link a bullet (and its page) to another page by putting the page’s name in a double square bracket or hashtag.</p><p>For example, if I’m editing a bullet on my “Marine Biology” page and I type [[SpongeBob]] or #SpongeBob, then I’ve linked that bullet to my “SpongeBob” page. What if I didn’t have a SpongeBob page? I do now, automatically. I can then go to my “SpongeBob” page and automatically see that “Marine Biology” references it, and maybe other pages reference it too.</p><p>While Workflowy encourages you to work within one top-level bullet at a time, Roam encourages you to split off lots of top-level “pages”. Even just putting a new word in [[brackets]] automatically makes it a page, so you find yourself dumping every concept-node in your brain as a page.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1r1dYmeeBlH2uqTfK_vwnA.png\" /><figcaption>A graph visualization of linked pages in Roam</figcaption></figure><p>If you’re writing bullets in Roam, and you just add a couple extra keystrokes once in a while, pretty soon you get a cool linked graph of pages. Then you can go through all your pages and flesh them out with more bullet points, and those will inspire linking to new pages that you’ll want to flesh out afterward. The overall effect is that Roam feels like dumping your brain into a “second brain”.</p><p>I think Roam’s data model of pages/cards full of bullets is powerful, and has never been properly explored in another tool before. I’m excited about that because I personally want to use that data model. I think it’s an incrementally better version of Workflowy’s bullets-only data model.</p><h3>What’s the Value Prop Story?</h3><p>Being made of a novel set of simple, powerful building blocks is a very good sign. But can we get more specific about what use cases this could get market traction for? What’s a <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">value prop story</a>?</p><h4>Story #1</h4><p>Joe drafts his blog posts in Workflowy and often gets ideas to write about related concepts. To keep track of those, he creates top-level bullets for those other concepts. But Workflowy isn’t that great at managing lots of top-level bullets, so Joe only creates a top-level bullet when he thinks his related concept is a promising candidate for a blog post. If Joe switches to Roam, he feels like his tangential ideas spill more easily out of his head without being prematurely filtered, because he can set them aside as linked Pages.</p><h4>Story #2</h4><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ganeumann/status/1217100870221008897\">@ganeumann</a></p></blockquote><p>Jerry has been using the Zettelkasten method with physical index cards. By switching to Roam, he gets to keep his same Zettelkasten patterns plus get the benefits of a digital medium: unlimited storage, easy copying, cloud backup, integrating images and multimedia. (And if he had switched to another tool like Notion or Workflowy instead of Roam, there would be more friction in attempting Zettelkasten, especially in trying to link one card/page to another.)</p><p>There are at least two well-formed Value Prop Stories for Roam, and they’re not hypothetical — they seem to describe some specific people I’ve seen talking about Roam on Twitter. I myself am kind of a Story #1 Joe. I currently pay for Workflowy and I think that Roam is significantly better than Workflowy for my needs.</p><h3>Is It Bloated?</h3><p>Roam has a clear hypothesis to test: <em>Will people prefer to structure their notes and drafts on top of a pages-&amp;-bullets data model?</em> The question is, did they build an MVP that efficiently puts that hypothesis to the test, or did they build a bunch of other bloated crap?</p><p>My verdict is… <strong>NOT BLOATED!</strong> Here’s why:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/842/1*KNX8oaTfhfdd4T2ORGdlNg.png\" /></figure><ul><li><strong>No major non-core features.</strong> They held back from building important, tempting, but non-critical features into MVP. While they couldn’t resist including a graph visualizer, they resisted including any <em>major</em> features that would have slowed down their launch, such as realtime multi-user collaboration, because those features weren’t necessary for validating their data model hypothesis.</li><li><strong>Minimalist design is a good call.</strong> The UI design they launched with does a good job of being simple. The product isn’t particularly pleasant-looking, but it’s very usable. The hypothesis they’re looking to prove is that data model is their key differentiator, not UI design. So de-prioritizing UI design was a good call.</li><li><strong>Smart compromises on performance/scalability.</strong> Right now it feels like a ton of the application is running client-side, so that when you have a lot of data and you search for a common keyword, it freezes your comp for a bit. That’s good! They prioritized making a fast experience for people who just write a handful of reasonably-sized notes. Because by the time you’ve written a handful of reasonably-sized notes, you get hooked on why Roam’s data model is superior, and you’ve validated the key hypothesis of their MVP.</li></ul><p>When I’d first read <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/Vu1MmjinS\">Roam’s White Paper</a>, I’d figured their product was likely to be a bloated MVP because the paper is full of abstract claims about how people think and why software should be better at helping people think, but lacks specifics about use cases or product features. I changed my mind when I read the authors’ note at the end:</p><blockquote>We wrote this White Paper in Winter of 2017/2018, and while it still reflects much of our vision for the tool, some of the features — particularly related to [[Bayesian Reasoning]], [[Argument Analysis]], and [[Prediction Markets]] we found to be in-fact much lower priority for the researchers and decision makers whose thinking we aim to assist — and risked making the tool too complex for the more significant use cases.</blockquote><p>So the Roam team seems self-aware that their white paper isn’t usable as a product roadmap. I don’t see any other red flags that their MVP or their product roadmap is bloated.</p><h3>Why I’m Excited</h3><p>I’ve switched to Roam for the kind of content drafting I used to do in Workflowy. I drafted this post in Roam.</p><p>I’m sold on Roam’s data-model hypothesis: that pages and bullets are a superior data model for drafting notes and creative works of all kinds. Roam’s competitors, other editing tools, make you work in multi-paragraph units, without the kind of dynamic rearrangeable structure you get when you write on index cards Zettelkasten-style.</p><p>Roam is good product today. How much more awesome can it get than it already is?</p><p>Let’s look at its product roadmap. These features and improvements are obvious, and I believe they’re all in the works right now:</p><ul><li>Performance and scalability improvements</li><li>Realtime multi-user collaboration</li><li>Mobile app</li><li>Developer API</li><li>Third-party integrations and data import/export</li><li>Bullet widgets — more goodies like the built-in widgets that let you use special bullet-text syntaxes to embed images, Tweets, todo items and range sliders. They’ll probably allow third-party widgets too.</li></ul><p>None of these upcoming features seems like as big of a leap forward as the current Roam MVP’s introduction of a new pages-&amp;-bullets data model. I suspect that’s the biggest innovation Roam will ever have to offer. So compared to Evernote, Google Docs, Notion and Workflowy, is Roam ultimately a huge qualitative leap forward, or an incremental one?</p><p>My guess is that it’s an Airtable-sized leap.</p><p><a href=\"https://airtable.com\">Airtable</a> is a 5-year-old tool that I use for a bunch of stuff at work. All it does is let you read and write tables of structured objects, and it has become a highly successful company last valued at $1.1 billion.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z9oHS0HeK-0r1p91VD5bEw.png\" /></figure><p>Airtable’s innovation was also data-model-based: While traditional spreadsheets like Excel and Google Sheets let you edit flexible grids of cells, Airtable uses less-flexible lists of records with primary keys and structured column types. It’s actually similar to Microsoft Access, a tool for editing database data.</p><p>Airtable may not have any more big innovations up their sleeve to differentiate themselves further and further from Excel, and that’s okay. The company is on track to create $billions of additional value with an increasingly sophisticated product built around a data-model innovation.</p><p>So is Roam.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=28baf5dd0a3\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/roam-research-mvp-review-pages-bullets-cool-new-product-category-28baf5dd0a3\">Roam Research MVP Review: Pages + Bullets = Cool New Product Category</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp\">Bloated MVP</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://www.listle.io\">Listle</a>, currently in the Summer 2019 batch of Y Combinator, recently launched their MVP in the form of a website, iOS app and Android app.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tP5cf4vXaysQKEoqcTxR1A.png\" /></figure><p>What’s the value prop? Well, here are my takeaways from reading the above-the-fold text on their home page:</p><ol><li>Listle provides audiorecordings of articles on the internet</li><li>Listle’s available content includes your favorite articles, as well as the best articles</li><li>Not only is Listle a source of audio content, it’s also a “place to listen” to that content</li><li>Getting new audio articles once per week is part of how you’re expected to use the product</li></ol><p>Does all of this add up to at least one coherent <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/how-to-sanity-check-your-startup-idea-dbb3ad4c9888\">value prop story</a>? Have they cleared this low bar, or do they risk having <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/your-mvp-is-bloated-3e89131b3cb\">zero users</a>?</p><h3>Am I a potential user?</h3><p>Step 1 of a value prop story is to describe a <strong>specific person with a specific problem</strong>. For Listle, I guess this person would be someone who listens to tons of spoken-word content but lacks certain online articles in the form of listenable content. Hey, maybe that’s me! <a href=\"https://medium.com/@lironshapira/wheres-the-twitter-of-podcasting-413dfb136197\">I listen</a> to ~2 hours/day of podcasts and audiobooks, plus I read ~2 hours/day of stuff online. So maybe I can use myself to build an existence proof of a value prop story.</p><p>Step 2 of a value prop story is describing this specific person’s current <strong>best effort to solve their problem</strong>. Do I have some kind of problem listening to spoken-word articles?</p><p>Usually when I identify an article that I want to read on the internet, I’m happy enough to just skim or read it. Maybe for longer articles where I bookmark to read later, I might have a problem of not being able to easily consume them in audio form when I’m walking my dog.</p><p>But personally, I don’t do much bookmarking of these articles. If I did, I probably would have experimented with using Instapaper together with text-to-speech. So I’m personally not super into this use case right now.</p><p>How about this: I often go back and re-read my favorite books and blogs that have had the biggest impact on me. For example, I’ve recently re-read:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rationality-AI-Zombies-Eliezer-Yudkowsky-ebook/dp/B00ULP6EW2\">Rationality: From AI to Zombies</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042XA2XG\">How the Mind Works</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html\">Paul Graham’s essays</a></li></ul><p>Would I have been interested to have had these in audio form instead?</p><ul><li>For <em>Rationality: From AI to Zombies</em>, I’ve alternated between reading its text and listening to its <a href=\"https://from-ai-to-zombies.eu/files.html\">audio version</a>.</li><li>For <em>How the Mind Works</em>, I actually did just re-listen to it on <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/How-the-Mind-Works-Audiobook/B0064DWG4K\">Audible</a>.</li><li>For Paul Graham’s essays, though it’s never occurred to me until now, I do think it would be nice at some point to hear a podcast of them, and I don’t think anyone has recorded them as audio yet.</li></ul><p>Now I’ve done a little introspection to see if I can be part of a value prop story, and I’m pretty lukewarm. From my personal perspective, it feels like most chunks of well-known content do have some kind of high-quality audio version available already. And any time I really want an audio version of a specific piece of content, it seems like the internet is likely to offer it to me (although it’s admittedly odd that my Google search for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=paul+graham+essays+audio\">“paul graham essays audio”</a> didn’t return anything good).</p><p>I’m starting to think that maybe I personally don’t have a burning need for Listle. Maybe I wasn’t in their target market after all?</p><p>My inability to reach this conclusion when looking at their home page is a red flag that they’ve built a bloated MVP.</p><h3>Is someone else a potential user?</h3><p>So let’s start over. Who specifically is this for? What’s one compelling value prop story we can tell? I’ll try again to work backward from their MVP to a value prop story:</p><blockquote>Larry spends an hour each day reading 3–5 long news stories online. He loves the content, but doesn’t like the long sessions staring at his iPad screen. He would pay to have them available in audio form instead.</blockquote><p>Ok, it’s plausible that the founders know a person like Larry in their lives, or they are Larrys themselves.</p><p>Remember that step 2 of a value prop story is to describe Larry’s best effort to solve his problem. In this case, Larry would probably already be using <a href=\"https://www.audm.com/\">Audm</a> (YC S17), right?</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u3sF9IawHzHqaEbDH8whrA.png\" /></figure><p>Then what would be the incremental improvement Larry gets in switching from Audm to Listle? I don’t know.</p><h3>You can request articles</h3><p>One feature I don’t understand is the ability to “request articles”. Apparently you can request an article to be turned into an audiorecording, and then wait hours or days to get that audiorecording in your library. To me that seems like a tedious workflow, but maybe it would be okay for someone who was really passionate about getting a certain article turned into audio. But again I have to ask: <em>who</em> is this person, this potential value-prop-story protagonist?</p><h3>It’s a “place to listen”</h3><p>Right now I personally have two places to regularly listen to audio: Audible and <a href=\"https://breaker.audio\">Breaker</a>. Do I really need a third place for audio versions of online articles?</p><p>It seems like they could add value by <em>not</em> being a place to listen, but just focusing on creating a feed of content to listen to.</p><p>For example, I currently read articles every day that come from my Twitter followees, email newsletters I subscribe to, and RSS feeds in <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a>. If I could automatically have an audio-RSS feed of all the articles I read, and have my Breaker app treat that feed just like a podcast I can listen to, I would definitely try incorporating it into my audio-listening habit. Maybe I’d like it.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Overall, I get the impression that the founders didn’t build Listle for me or Larry or anyone. They’re building before having a value prop story. But they’re a young startup; they haven’t wasted that many person-months. Hopefully they’ll hit on a value prop story soon.</p><p>In the meantime, I’ll count them among the 80% of startups who demonstrate the thesis of this blog.</p><p><strong><em>Update Aug 2019:</em></strong> There’s now a <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/golden-is-a-bloated-mvp-2797105cdd36\">Golden</a> page about Listle <a href=\"https://golden.com/wiki/Listle\">here</a> #bloatedmvpsquared</p><h3><strong><em>Update Jun 2020</em></strong></h3><p>In the last year, Listle has iterated quickly on their product. It now looks like they have a clear value prop and plenty of active users, i.e. <strong>not a bloated MVP!</strong> It goes to show how powerful it is to iterate quickly and not give up.</p><p>Their value prop is now focused on giving you daily news in audio form:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*INT7r60Azg5iWd-FdfDhFw.png\" /></figure><p>A specific value prop story might be: Liron wants to catch up on the day’s news and blogs while walking his dog. He’s not satisfied with listening to <em>The Daily</em> or any particular news podcast; he also wants to consume news and blog content that doesn’t have its own podcast. So he opens the “Today’s Stories” playlist in his Listle app. His next-best alternative would be to save the articles in Pocket and use its text-to-speech feature, or listen to news podcasts, or use another app like Audm that provides spoken versions of articles.</p><p>I originally pointed out that Listle may be an Audm competitor but it isn’t clearly explained that way. Now it’s more clear that they’re competing directly with Audm. But they have their own approach, more focused on short form and long tail.</p><p>I still think their original MVP from last year was bloated, and that they built a lot of functionality that had to be changed later because they didn’t have a specific use case or target audience in mind. The team could have saved a few person-months of their lives by focusing their thinking on specific users and their specific value prop stories.</p><p>But as I pointed out in the conclusion, they had only wasted a few person-months, not much more. Overall, this is a startup that found market traction at a reasonably fast pace, and wasn’t too bloated in the grand scheme of things.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1b3dcb0c8f5b\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp/listle-yc-s19-mvp-review-who-needs-a-place-to-listen-1b3dcb0c8f5b\">Listle (YC S19) MVP Review: A “place to listen”, but for who?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/bloated-mvp\">Bloated MVP</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n"

And somehow get out the vote (GOTV) efforts are missing one of the most critical aspects of this year’s election.</p><p>Hoards of people are working tirelessly to get people registered to vote and voting. Organizations are agonizing over the most impactful way to write a “remember to vote” letter. People are making GOTV phone calls and having to armor up to face rejection after rejection. Nonprofits are fantasizing about what inspirational SMS messages will motivate a potential voter to register.</p><p>But they might not be asking one critical question that could sneakily be the difference between someone voting and not: <strong>do they have a printer?</strong></p><p>In behavioral science, we analyze the environments in which people act. And in the world of COVID-19, the environment leading up to this year’s election is unique. Voter registration and voting has historically been a paper-based, in-person activity. And in many states if you are registering to vote and/or voting by mail you have to print out a form and mail it in.</p><p>As we’ve increasingly become more digital, in many cases we’ve <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-recycle-or-donate-your-old-printer\">abandoned our printers</a>. And with the ongoing pandemic, remote workers may no longer have access to their work printers, partially explaining the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-2020-werent-strange-enough-printers-are-staging-a-comeback/2020/06/30/1e800ad0-bada-11ea-97c1-6cf116ffe26c_story.html\">resurgence</a> in printer purchases for some. Printers range from <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/inkjet-printers/3944_3951_37807_163957_2713574\">$35 to over $400</a>, so for others, especially younger and lower-income voters, printers <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/02/remember-printing-stuff-out.html\">aren’t something they own</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/0*Cyi9Jq98ExmcjoQj\" /></figure><p>As of the end of March, <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Online_voter_registration\">11 states</a> did not have online voter registration systems. That means that everyone in those states is required to mail in a voter registration form.</p><p>And in the other 39 states where online voter registration exists, most states require <a href=\"https://azsos.gov/elections/voting-election/register-vote-or-update-your-current-voter-information\">state-issued IDs</a> to register to vote online, otherwise mailing in a paper voter registration form is required. Photo IDs are less commonly held by <a href=\"http://www.projectvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AMERICANS-WITH-PHOTO-ID-Research-Memo-February-2015.pdf\">younger and poorer Americans</a>, precisely the ones who are least likely to have printers.</p><p>Currently only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/11/us/politics/vote-by-mail-us-states.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">eight states and DC</a> currently plan to mail registered voters ballots directly. And while some states like <a href=\"https://myvote.wi.gov/en-US/VoteAbsentee\">Wisconsin</a> allow for online mail-in ballot applications, others like <a href=\"https://www.alabamainteractive.org/sos/voter_registration/voterRegistrationWelcome.action\">Alabama</a> require a printed application for a mail-in ballot.</p><p>So, while a potential voter may receive a very convincing letter, email, or phone call, once they start the voting process in many cases they’re going to have to print out a piece of paper either to register to vote or to request a mail-in ballot. For many this big friction point requires high levels of motivation (and potentially health risks) to overcome, and travel to FedEx or Kinko’s to print (and pay for) these forms.</p><p>The answer to this problem and possibly the single most effective thing that GOTV orgs can do is:</p><p><strong>Mail the paper voting forms that have to be printed out to people, and include a pre-addressed and stamped envelope so they can be easily mailed in.</strong></p><p>Hassles reduce the likelihood of doing anything.

Diabetes is a serious chronic condition that can lead to other serious health complications. However, when equipped with the proper lifestyle habits, such as a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and appropriate medication, people with diabetes can reduce many of these health risks. As such, behavior change to create long-term healthy habits has become an important answer to managing diabetes.</p><p>Livongo provides a whole person platform that empowers people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives. Many of the people with diabetes who are eligible for the Livongo program are covered through their employer’s health plan, giving new members a cellular-connected blood glucose meter, unlimited refills of strips and lancets, and access to personalized guidance from a Certified Diabetes Educator at no cost to them. One of the ways in which we communicate to individuals about their eligibility for the program is through email. After reviewing our messaging and communication strategy, we realized that there was an opportunity to amplify the immediate benefit of enrolling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6iVyw38SJpn4-lZR1D_DEA.jpeg\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LMFDekcmH7-p6FtIcs7s6w.png\" /><figcaption>Livongo Device &amp; Welcome Kit</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Experiment Overview</strong></h3><p>We conducted an email experiment with our Spring seasonal campaign that we send out to all eligible individuals. New members who complete the registration process receive a Livongo Welcome Kit containing strips, lancets, and an advanced blood glucose meter that provides personalized insights with each check. We tested whether changing the thematic copy elements from “Join the Program” to “Claim Your Welcome Kit” in the subject line, headline, call-to-action button, and email body would impact click-through rates. From a behavioral perspective, “claim” leverages the following:</p><p>1. Social Proof — It highlights a sense of scarcity by implying other people are claiming this limited resource</p><p>2. Endowment Effect — It creates a sense of ownership over the limited resource</p><p>3. Halo Effect — It departs from any possible negative connotations associated with the word “program”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gGkNVqHVoXXax1FnNFWHhQ.png\" /><figcaption>“Join the Program” email — Control</figcaption></figure><p>The “Join the Program” email served as our control condition and our “Claim Your Welcome Kit” email served as our experimental condition.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wA83m-4fBCY6tcLbes52nQ.png\" /><figcaption>“Claim Your Welcome Kit” email — Test Condition</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Results</strong></h3><p>We emailed over 15,000 people with diabetes eligible for the Livongo for Diabetes program. We saw statistically significant differences in engagement between our two conditions. Our “Claim Your Welcome Kit” condition <strong>increased open rates by 25% </strong>and <strong>click-through rates by 88%</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Impact</strong></h3><p>Our experiment increased our registration rate within 1 week of the email outreach by more than <strong>120%</strong>. The results has strongly influenced how we measure the potential impact of applying behavioral principles to seemingly minor elements of our communication strategy. As a result, we will continue experimenting with the “Claim Your Welcome Kit” theme across other touchpoints with our potential members, including our direct mail campaigns, landing pages, and other emails.</p><p><a href=\"https://behavioraleconomicsbootcamp.com/\"><strong><em>See 2020 dates for Irrational Labs’ Behavioral Economics Bootcamp and apply today.</em></strong></a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8039de5a67a9\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/behavioral-economics-1/experimenting-a-case-study-from-a-be-bootcamper-8039de5a67a9\">Experimenting: A Case Study from a BE Bootcamper</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/behavioral-economics-1\">Hacking Behavior</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n",

They might not publish peer-reviewed papers, but they do take advantage of their access to thousands (or sometimes millions) of customers, as well as technology that enables trying lots of new things. Today, the most innovative businesses (Intuit, P&amp;G, Google, Amazon, Netflix) have publicly stated they run thousands of experiments (Clarke, 2016). While this pace may only be achievable by the most sophisticated companies, experimentation platforms like Optimizely and Amplitude unlock off-the-shelf AB testing capabilities for small-to-medium sized companies. The end result is a high-speed learning model and a hard-to-ignore source of insights on human behavior and motivation.</p><p>As a behavioral science consulting firm that has worked with hundreds of companies from a broad array of industries, we see an opportunity for academics to pay attention to the insights this model has to offer. This article will pull from direct work experience and interviews with clients and partners. Our team has run over 50 experiments with companies across industries, including Facebook, Lilly, Aetna, Lyft, Kiva, AARP, as well as many smaller startups.</p><p>First, we’ll focus on companies’ growing appreciation for academic insights and how they are currently being used. Second, we’ll highlight the under-explored opportunity — what insights academics can glean from the sheer volume of experiments that is happening at companies.</p><p><strong>Application of Academic Insights by Companies</strong></p><p>There are three insights that we think companies are particularly well-versed in. 1) They notice a difference between stated and revealed preferences; 2) Choice architecture matters; 3) People are influenced by social proof and norms.</p><p><strong>1. There Is a Difference Between Stated and Revealed Preferences: Customers Don’t Always Do What They Say They Will</strong></p><p>Companies, for the most part, still rely on interviews, focus groups, and surveys to inform new feature development. However, with the growing ability to capture product usage and analyze data, companies are discovering that there is a difference between stated and revealed preferences (Samuelson, 1948). Customers might say they prefer one thing, but end up choosing something else.</p><p>The launch of Facebook’s News Feed offers an example. Before this feature launched, Facebook users had to click on friends’ profiles to see their updates. The News Feed pushed people’s updates into a feed, enabling users to see all their friends’ updates at once. Immediately after it launched, Facebook users were generally furious. One man, Ben Parr, even created a group called “Students Against Facebook News Feed” that gained 700,000 members within a number of days (Stephens-Davidowitz, 2017).</p><p>In this case, we might think a company would backtrack. Yet, Facebook did not do so: “Zuckerberg in fact knew that people liked the News Feed, no matter what they were saying in the groups. He had the data to prove it. People were spending more time on Facebook… And they were doing more there — dramatically more” (Kirkpatrick, 2010).</p><p>A second example of a gap between stated and revealed preferences is from Thumbtack, an online marketplace that connects and aggregates service providers like handymen and painters with people in need of their services. During onboarding, Thumbtack will ask service providers about their skillset, experience, types of jobs they may want, and how much they might charge for their services. The images below show which preferences Thumbtack might ask a handyman.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nRrr_U3MpNQZA9F9yIFaLA.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: </strong>Onboarding question about work type preference</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dAF41naKVOr-3muoUzUvgA.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Onboarding question about price</figcaption></figure><p>Thumbtack has observed a significant difference between what jobs service-providers <em>say </em>they are willing to do, and what jobs they <em>actually take</em>. “Their revealed preferences are, on average, substantially broader than their stated preferences when it comes to finding new projects to complete,” shares Lucas Puente, Lead Economist at Thumbtack. When Thumbtack offers them jobs outside the realms of their stated preferences (perhaps involving a different type of property or task than they originally selected) or price points, but match their location and skillset, many still take the work on.</p><p><strong>2. Choice Architecture, or How Options Are Presented, Matters</strong></p><p>Companies have a growing appreciation that the <em>way </em>choices are presented to consumers, termed <em>choice architecture</em>, has a strong impact on consumers’ decision-making. Many companies have internalized basic behavioral science wisdom that layout, range, and sequencing of options have an effect on what people ultimately choose (Johnson et al., 2012; Balz, Sunstein, &amp; Thaler, 2014).</p><p>OKPanda, an English-language learning app, discovered the power of using choice architecture within their sign-up flow. Adam Gries, founder, explains that when the students first sign-up, they need to select what type of teacher they prefer. The main decision is between a native- speaking English teacher and a non-native English-speaking teacher. Through experimentation, OKPanda learned it was more effective, from a conversion standpoint, to have people answer a multiple-choice question upfront about their preferences than to present a list of teachers with key attributes listed on their profile (e.g., native or non-native).</p><p>Thumbtack has also experienced the power of choice architecture. They have found consumers are more likely to select the professional that first appears on the app who seems to meet their needs, particularly in certain categories where “done” is more important than “perfect.” In other words, Thumbtack noticed a lot of users were “satisficing,” a decision-making strategy where people select the alternative that is “good enough,” rather than putting in effort to find the best possible choice (Simon, 1978).</p><p><strong>3. People Are Influenced by Social Proof and Norms</strong></p><p>The use of <em>social proof </em>by companies is widespread (Das et al., 2014; Alcott &amp; Rogers, 2014; Amblee &amp; Bui, 2010). Perhaps the best-known example of leveraging social norms to drive behavior change has been conducted by Opower. They demonstrated that presenting social norm messaging about how much energy people’s neighbors were saving can be scaled to influence energy conservation across an entire community (Alcott, 2011; Zaval &amp; Cornwell, 2016).</p><p>Information on what peers are doing can be especially enticing. Thumbtack shared that some of their most effective marketing campaigns revolved around the message of “what your neighbors are getting done on Thumbtack.” Additionally, one of the authors, Kristen, ran an experiment with Arizona Federal Credit Union that used social proof to help reduce spending on eating out (Common Cents, 2018). An email was sent to people in the experiment with a subject line that asked: “Curious how your spending on eating out compares to others?” This email had a click through rate that was 2.4 times higher than previous emails sent by the credit union.</p><p><strong>Lessons from Companies</strong></p><p>Based on our work with hundreds of companies, three main ideas stand out as a good start for the field of social science to learn from companies:</p><ol><li>There are more nuanced ways to think about friction,</li><li>There are ways to build intuition faster, even within an academic context, and</li><li>There may be benefits from research lacking generalizability.</li></ol><p><strong>1. Friction Is Complex — It Can Be Bad and Good</strong></p><p>Behavioral science has shown that people can be deterred from taking action by even minor amounts of choice, added steps, time, effort, and decision-making. These types of behavioral “frictions” (perceived or real) generally decrease the probability that a given behavior takes place, and also account for a number of human biases (e.g., Murray &amp; Haubl, 2007). For example, our propensity to stick with the status quo (Samuelson &amp; Zeckhauser, 1988; Kahneman, Knetsch, &amp; Thaler, 1991) and with defaults (Johnson &amp; Goldstein, 2003), or avoid making difficult choices (Chernev, Böckenholt, &amp; Goodman, 2016), are all examples of the power of friction. Designing for low friction is generally understood and accepted in companies. Evan Willams, founder of Twitter, has said that the key to making a fortune online is to remove extra steps from common activities (Wired, 2013).</p><p>The general approach of making designs simple and usable is accepted in industry, and focuses on the reduction of friction. However, there is an emerging understanding that some types of friction actually make designs more usable, not less.</p><p>The first way friction within a system can be helpful is that it helps change the cost-benefit equation by decreasing the perception of future costs. One example comes from Ethan Smith, Growth Advisor at MasterClass, an online learning platform. Like many other products, MasterClass originally asked users for their email and credit card on a single screen (see Figure 3).</p><p>MasterClass then tested separating the email field and credit card fields onto two different screens, which is in direct contrast to design ‘best practices’ that recommend fewer steps is better due to the extra click required (see Figures 4 &amp; 5).</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*sEdeoDOux-KIa-nTT9bfcw.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: </strong>Email and credit card on one screen</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/631/1*TiIzaFUDmSyMF1tx1jN_hA.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figures 4 and 5: </strong>Email and credit card split across screens</figcaption></figure><p>What MasterClass found, however, was a substantial increase in subscriptions, which is potentially attributable to the idea that even though the number of steps increased, the perceived level of “ask” on each step was reduced.</p><p>Goodui.org has reported similar results. Goodui.org is a platform that aggregates experimental results across different contexts, providing members with insights into effective design techniques. They report on a two-condition experiment. One condition has all the sign-up fields on one page, and the second condition breaks up the fields onto two pages.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rV8RcMEa13qUamRUcFzRnA.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 6: </strong>Create account followed by personal details on one screen</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aqb-aRoMMh-SlaUjZpjtsg.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figures 7 and 8: </strong>Create Account is on the first screen; Personal Details are on the second</figcaption></figure><p>Like MasterClass, the number of steps increased, but the amount of information collected stayed the same. And like MasterClass, doing this increased conversion (8.7% to 11.7%). Goodui.org includes this example in a series of five tests that all examine the effect of splitting up steps into multiple screens. Based on these five tests, they conclude that splitting up steps is a winning strategy that will likely increase conversion, with a 5.5% median effect.</p><p>A third example comes from Trunk Club, a clothing subscription service. To increase the number of site visitors that sign up for its service, Trunk Club tested a change to its sign-up flow. The new flow added more steps but allowed the user to focus on each question individually, with visuals supporting each question. Launching this experiment was a risk; the longer flow increased the number of opportunities a user had to drop out of the experience. However, the experiment results showed that the longer flow increased conversion by 133% (The Big Book of Experimentation, Optimizely).</p><p>In these examples, people became more motivated to continue when there were more, not fewer, steps. Ethan Smith explains:</p><p>Contrary to ‘best practices,’ adding more steps to a flow often does not reduce conversion. In fact, it can increase conversion. Users tend to focus on the current screen and the immediate decision of whether to continue or exit. They perform cost benefit analyses for each step. By reducing steps on each individual screen and separating them into more screens with fewer steps, the user perceives a reduced cost on each screen. This seemingly small change in the cost benefit equation can lead to dramatic increases in conversion.</p><p>It might be the case that there is a difference between <em>actual </em>friction and <em>perceived </em>friction. Breaking fields up into multiple steps does not allow people to fully consider all of the future costs in their decision making. They evaluate only one cost at a time.</p><p>Another type of “good” friction that increases conversion is friction that builds a customer’s mental model of the product, and thus increases their intention to convert. Smith shares an example from Apartment List, an online apartment rental marketplace.</p><p>Apartment List increased conversion by adding relevant and easy to complete steps in their sign up flow (e.g., asking a user looking for an apartment how many bedrooms they need, their price range, and which features they want). While these additional questions increased friction for the user, these questions show the customer the potential benefits they will receive if they complete the flow. This change in the perceived benefit changes the cost benefit equation resulting in dramatically more users finding their new home.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/609/1*qHxTDx1bTAsmpfhhZ9QP-g.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figures 9 and 10: </strong>User preferences shown at the top of the screen</figcaption></figure><p>This approach is currently being used at other companies. StitchFix is a subscription personal styling service. Given StitchFix’s relative newness to the market, it may be unclear how the service works and what benefits it can offer potential customers. To mitigate this, StitchFix asks questions in its sign-up flow that clarify the benefits the service can provide. For example, as shown below, they cleverly highlight multiple benefits by asking “What are the reasons you’re excited to try Stitch Fix?”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*vdPWWQBZTgc-vOOFVi55Zg.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 11: </strong>Question that helps the consumer understand the value of StitchFix</figcaption></figure><p>StitchFix also asks users if they want help with outfits for work, casual, or date nights. Without this question, users may assume Stitch Fix only handles one type of wardrobe — i.e., the business dress.</p><p>And finally, sometimes, friction might intrinsically be helpful. By slowing users down, it can increase general commitment and help them make better decisions. One example comes from Secret Escapes, a flash-sale travel company that offers discounted rates on 4–5 star hotels. Before launching their app, their internal team was conflicted about whether to allow users to see the travel deals without signing up (inputting their email and password). To test this, they ran an experiment. In the first condition, users were able to close or skip the sign-up screen. In the second condition, sign-up was required and no skip option was offered. The second condition, that forced users to sign-up, was the winning condition. It doubled the sign-up rate without negatively impacting reviews (see Figures 12 &amp; 13) (The Big Book of Experimentation, Optimizely).</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4CQuU-Kv8x1fijl-LXfjeQ.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figures 12 and 13: </strong>Skip option allowed vs no skip option. <em>Source</em>: The Big Book of Experimentation, Optimizely</figcaption></figure><p>OKPanda observed a similar finding. People completed more language learning sessions when they were required to put down a credit card to activate the one-month free trial than those who were not asked to put down a credit card to activate it. Founder Adam Gries believes this was due to helping people actively commit to trying out the product. People who experienced no friction never fully committed to their free month.</p><p>Friction is complex. While most of the time, friction might prevent certain behaviors, companies are telling a more nuanced story. In this case, we show that some companies have found friction may be “good” if it serves to 1) decrease the perception of costs 2) increase attention to future benefits or 3) increase the likelihood of commitment. More research is needed to validate these hypotheses.</p><p><strong>2. Build Intuition Faster</strong></p><p>Our experience is that shortening the cycle for intuition-building is one of the most useful parts of companies’ execution speed. One of our clients, CUNA Mutual Group, asked us to help them with their unemployment insurance product, SafetyNet, which pays out up to $9,000 if the insured individual becomes unemployed. Building on the research that adding context to statistics helps people digest them (Barrio, Goldstein, &amp; Hofman, 2016) we suggested the team translate the payout of $9,000 into something that a consumer could more easily relate to.</p><p>Within just a few days, CUNA Mutual Group launched an experiment. Some customers saw the original page, and some customers saw a new page with three added statements, “John paid rent,” “Jen covered daycare,” and “Sara paid medical bills” underneath the main benefit of the $9,000 payout. Within days, they had enough traffic to see that the new version had increased page-over-page conversion by 3%. With this data, they worked with their Marketing Department to implement the changes more formally with improved images and an integrated design.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uEC59rm735fBNQ2dgJCSVA.png\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 14: </strong>CUNA Mutual Group’s job insurance page updated with concrete examples of how the benefit could be used</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to quickly running tests on their own websites, companies also often run tests using Facebook or Google ads. This strategy is often even faster, requiring less internal coordination and fewer approvals. Duke University’s Common Cents Lab implemented such a test that informed a partnership with Lendstreet. With the goal of reducing consumer debt, the team wanted to understand the most effective ways to get consumers to call their credit card companies and ask for lower interest rates. The team launched a 7-condition experiment on Google AdWords with different messaging, and then measured the call rates for each message.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/742/0*7M8UW7_vKqlS5TfU\" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 15: </strong>Example of what each ad looked like</figcaption></figure><p>Academics run pre-tests, but they are often confined to student samples or MTurk studies. When moving from lab testing to field experimentation, there might be risks. To mitigate these risks, companies have realized it is worth the investment to develop clever ways to conduct low-cost, low-risk pre-tests in the field.</p><p><strong>3. What We Can Learn from a Lack of Generalizability</strong></p><p>In academia, it’s important to develop interventions that are able to generalize across a population. Generalizability is a measure of how useful the results of a study are for a broader group of people or situations; lack of generalizability is therefore often an evil to be avoided. Lack of generalizability can arise if the participant pool is limited to certain narrow characteristics (e.g., small age range, narrow income band, specific location). Interestingly, companies don’t appear to care about this. Imagine that a company launches a feature that it hopes will help all of their customers. Instead, a smaller subset of users actually opt in to use the feature. In this case, the company does not care about the intent-to-treat effect or to understand if the feature might have a similar effect on customers that do not opt in.</p><p>Instead, they analyze data to see if the feature increased their business metrics for the subset of customers that did opt in, compared to customers that did not. They are effectively ignoring selection bias — these two groups (people who opt in and people who don’t opt in) may be completely different types of people. Yet, if the new feature improves business outcomes for this small subset, the company might put more effort into designing interventions for that subset in hopes they can convince more customers to opt in.</p><p>For example, a popular SaaS company completed an analysis of which users were likely to continue past the free trial period. They found that users were more likely to stay beyond the trial period if they had added another user, such as a colleague, to the service within the first week. The team then put significant effort into ensuring that all new users were nudged to add a colleague within the first week. As another example, Facebook employees have shared that in Facebook’s early days, if a new user added 7 friends in ten days to Facebook, they were likely to be a user for life. Based on this correlation, the team designed a sign-up flow to get people to add 7 friends.</p><p>What appears to be happening is not a confusion on causality and correlation (although in some companies it might be), but rather a strategic decision. They have found it is easier to focus on learning from their best users, even if is a self-selected sample, than exerting effort to create a representative user sample that would generalize better.</p><p>Adam Gries of OKPanda shares that he, too, started with an initial strategy of “going after everybody.” However, when the team looked at their user data, they found that only users who demonstrated interest in creating a “language learning plan” ended up being the most successful. The team, seeing this data, focused on getting more good users — the “plan-creating users” — and let go of trying to convert the super-casual users that had no interest in creating a plan.</p><p>Moreover, while this strategy will never allow practitioners to conclude the causal direction of an effect (for example, perhaps most successful users are the ones who would want to create a language learning plan), it does help practitioners narrow in on their most engaged customers.</p><p>We recommend that academics internalize this type of thinking for some research projects. At times it may be okay (and even desirable) to have behavioral insights that do not generalize to everyone. Focusing research on the subset of people for whom intervention would be most useful can be an easier and a potentially more impactful strategy.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Much has already been written about the rise of behavioral science and the demand from companies to apply academic insights to improve business outcomes. Indeed, last year’s Behavioral Economics Guide opened with an introduction from Robert Cialdini on the golden age of behavioral science. Cialdini, supporting this notion of bi-directional influence, suggested that this “love affair” between businesses and academics would develop into a “comfortable interdependence” moving forward.</p><p>And it is happening. Companies are increasingly looking to the social science world for insights on human behavior, in hopes they can build better products. Companies are also experimenting. They are learning what drives their customers’ behavior. Often, the insights they discover are old news to the social science community. But sometimes, companies are on the edge of new and interesting insights that could lead to a greater understanding of human behavior. This can only be good for a more symbiotic relationship to develop.</p><p><em>Full citations can be found in the </em><a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/the-be-guide/the-behavioral-economics-guide-2019/\"><em>2019 Behavioral Economics guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://behavioraleconomicsbootcamp.com/\"><strong><em>See 2020 dates for Irrational Labs’ Behavioral Economics Bootcamp and apply today.</em></strong></a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2665a21b4dca\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/behavioral-economics-1/what-academics-can-learn-from-industry-2665a21b4dca\">What Academics Can Learn from Industry</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/behavioral-economics-1\">Hacking Behavior</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n",

In a panel moderated by the NYTimes’ Rebecca Blumenstein, the experts debated causes of the misinformation epidemic, what it means for politics, and what on earth can be done about it.</p><p>Despite evidence of Russian interference and bots, Microsoft researcher Duncan Watts thinks the bigger culprits are still politicians and television. MIT’s Adam Berinsky isn’t as quick to give other communication platforms a pass, however; news outlets are amplifying — and polarizing — messages as they go.</p><p>But how powerful are actual news outlets? Not very, it seems.<a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/10/jobs-trump-coal-miners-journalism/\"> Journalists are losing jobs faster than coal miners</a>, Blumentstein points out. And Watts shared that almost half of the US reads no news on their desktop, while almost three quarters spends less than 30 seconds per day reading news online.¹ When people have so little exposure to real news, what chance does the truth have?</p><p>It isn’t all gloom and doom, though. The panelists were optimistic that technology can help curb the spread of fake news and empower people to interact productively with politicians.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/532/1*iqNUT1xnmCxl-lPCflSuVA.png\" /><figcaption>Cass Sunstein</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Have you checked your pipes? </strong>Harvard’s Cass Sunstein recommends that every organization conduct a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3379367\">sludge audit</a>.</p><p><em>Sludge </em>is a nudge used for bad. It can discourage behavior that is in a person’s best interest or it can encourage self-defeating behavior. Sunstein dug deep on paperwork and administrative burdens that prevent people from accessing aid and services, as well as wasting a ton of time and money.</p><p>Take, for example, the Earned Income Tax Credit. Millions of low-income Americans fail to claim this benefit even though they’re eligible because the rules around it are so complex. Meanwhile, the IRS has sufficient information to automatically make this credit available to those who qualify, without making them jump through paperwork hoops. And last year, 2.4 million infants were eligible for the government’s Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition program, but 80% of eligible infants didn’t receive the aid. The applications and systems surrounding access of benefits are notoriously complex to navigate, and those in greatest need are usually the least able to take on an additional burden.</p><p>Removing sludge is work, but highly effective. In a <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2019/preliminary/paper/RehssS62\">study by Dynarski</a> and team, the researchers showed that removal of administrative hurdles (such as filling out the FAFSA) made low-income students twice as likely to apply and enroll at a selective university.</p><p>There <em>are </em>circumstances where one person’s sludge is another one’s nudge. For example, Sunstein references a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/12162\">study by Luca et al.</a> that shows handgun waiting periods reduce homicides by 17%. The added friction slows down an individual’s actions but the process is beneficial for society as a whole.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/511/1*2USrgWiJ0bDE-s7uXAXYzg.png\" /><figcaption>left: Paul Slovic, right: Jon Haidt</figcaption></figure><p><strong>“There’s nothing more powerful in the world than a good story,”</strong> said nobody at BSPA, since this is a quote from Game of Thrones character Tyrion Lannister.

But she would eventually tire of the routine, and fall back into a sedentary lifestyle. She could never find an exercise routine that stuck.</p><p>In her early 30s, Kate bought her first house, allowing her to finally get her own dog, a 3-year-old border collie. Kate now had little choice but to take her dog on walks. Previously she would come home from work and turn on the TV. With her new dog, she now couldn’t do this. The tail wag and excited barks meant one thing — the dog wanted to exercise. Kate soon went from never walking to being someone who was going on 20–30 minutes walks every day. The walking stuck.</p><p>Why did this work?</p><p>Nobody pushed Kate to go to the gym. Or tell her how risky her weight was to overall longevity. Kate just bought a dog. A dog. The dog pushed her to walk — every day! Getting a dog was a one-time behavior that drove radical behavior change.</p><p>In the world of tech design, development and marketing, there’s an almost rabid focus on compelling consumers to adopt new habits as a way to get them hooked on a product … to make engagement KPIs soar and increase the bottom line. <em>Sometimes</em> that focus pays off.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DslM9L8fSyR1mBcWc9VT4Q.jpeg\" /></figure><p>But, like crash diets, products and apps that encourage consumers to form a new habit more often than not fail or backfire in the long run. As Wendy Wood has said, <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/good-habits-bad-habits-a-conversation-with-wendy-wood/\">“We form habits based on what’s easy and rewarding, what’s easy for us to do repeatedly and what’s rewarding in our context in the places where we live.”</a> It’s easy and rewarding to check Facebook and see what has been posted. It’s much less rewarding and much less easy to do 10 sit ups in the morning, do homework from your online course every day or meditate for 10 minutes a day. Thus apps that push us to form daily habits, have an uphill battle in front of them. They are competing for consumers’ attention, which is already in short supply, scattered and finite.</p><p>Furthermore, triggering habits is a tricky thing to achieve because the reward has to be attached immediately to the behavior. This means they must intersect you at the perfect moment or the system will not work. When has an app notification hit you at the exact moment you have needed it? Rarely. Finally, <strong>the best evidence is that it can take two to three months to form a simple habit. This is a non trivial amount of time. </strong>App developers and designers must reflect on this intrusion and figure out if it’s worth it — adopting yet another habit may not ultimately be in your customers’ best interests.</p><p>Habits aren’t a bad thing, per se, and are a normal and necessary part of our lives. Most of the things we do, such as brushing our teeth and switching off unused lights, are so ingrained that we do them without thinking. This frees our minds to focus on bigger things that demand our complete attention, such as running a business, keeping children healthy and making family budget decisions.</p><p>On the other hand, creating habits among users is likely not the best route for product developers to take, as it is a resource-intensive process with no guarantee of success. As mentioned above, It typically takes about two to three months to develop a new habit, assuming the behavior is consistently repeated over the course of that time period. Think about the times you have planned to exercise daily or vowed to water your plants: Were you able to succeed the first time you committed to changing your behavior, or did it take multiple attempts? Habits take time, commitment, motivation and mental energy.</p><h3>Creating a new habit is a resource-intensive process with no guarantee of success.</h3><p>Additionally, habits can be incredibly intrusive. A<a href=\"https://www.globalwebindex.com/hubfs/Downloads/2019%20Q1%20Social%20Flagship%20Report.pdf\"> recent study</a> found that Internet users spend an average of 2 hours and 20 minutes on social media and messaging platforms <em>every day! </em>Not exactly the best use of time, our most precious resource. Think about how engagement with your application looks in a user’s life and whether it’s merely adding screen time without increasing productivity, health, happiness or financial well-being.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*opxu51G-fLpLkqbE7U3CSQ.jpeg\" /></figure><h3>What if there were a different, better way to get consumers to commit to a product?</h3><p>One that involved not simply adopting a new habit but doing something that would produce a natural domino effect for the user’s benefit? That alternative is designing for a <em>one-time behavior—</em>instead of trying to trigger a behavior change by creating a habit among your users, create an environment where a one-time action might result in the same behavior change. Ask your product team, “Can you design a one-time intervention that compels the user to take one big action that delivers the same benefit as a habit?” i.e. “Can you get them a dog?”</p><h3>Instead of trying to trigger a behavior change by trying to create a habit among your users, create an environment where a one-time action might result in the same behavior change.</h3><p>Here are some examples of one-time behaviors that have far-reaching, organic results.</p><ul><li>Buy a dog in order to walk more (as Kate did).</li><li>Buy a Roomba (robotic vacuum cleaner) to inspire you to keep your home clean.</li><li>Sign up for a fruit or vegetable box subscription so you’ll plan for and eat healthy meals.</li><li>Prep the coming week’s meals on Sundays (i.e., cook all of your food for the week at once) so you’re less likely to waste money and calories on unhealthy takeout food.</li><li>Set up auto-pay on your banking app so you pay your bills on time every month.</li><li>Set up an automatic payment from your paycheck to your savings account so you don’t have to remember to save money.</li><li>Pre-schedule regular workout meetings with friends to use social pressure as a motivator to exercise.</li><li>Delete your social media accounts so you stop spending so much time on them (and maybe give your password to your Mom so you can’t log back in).</li><li>Get rid of the TV in your bedroom (or even all of the TVs in your home) so you can free up time to spend more purposefully.</li></ul><p>Product developers need to be intentional about the behaviors and metrics they design for and how those behaviors impact users’ lives in the long run. Think about your application, product or website. What’s the behavior you want your users to adopt, and is there a one-time intervention you can use to get them to adhere to that behavior?</p><p>By focusing on behavior, rather than obsessing over the buzzword of “habits,” we can let some of our behavioral biases — like <a href=\"https://peoplescience.maritz.com/Articles/2019/Know-Your-Nuggets-Default-Bias\">default bias</a> (auto-pay), social pressure and pre-commitment (workout meetings) — to overcome others and create better outcomes.</p><p><strong><em>Have a one-time behavior to add to the list?

The word “smartphone addiction” has casually entered our lexicon, and <a href=\"http://digitaldetox.org/retreats/\">digital detox retreats</a> are a real thing. Articles that try to help reduce phone use are a dime a dozen, giving tactics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/turning-smartphone-greyscale-attention-distraction-colour\">turning the phone greyscale</a>, or using <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/6e56m6/dev_fight_your_smartphone_addiction_using_the/\">a Pomodoro for focus time</a>. Most recently, Nir Eyal, author of <em>Hooked</em>, has, in an ironic twist, published a whole book on how each of us can proactively reduce the grip of mobile devices on our life.</p><p>While that sounds logical at first glance, it mistakenly puts the burden on the individual to stand alone and fight off the endless attackers of their attention. A strategy that primarily relies on the individual to proactively make changes is insufficient and set up for failure.</p><p>Why? For one, such a strategy incorrectly assumes most people can predict what their future self will do, and given that prediction, take action to ensure they align their behavior with their intentions.</p><p>This is too difficult. Humans have been shown to have time-inconsistent preferences. While we may want to study later tonight, when we actually get home, the thing we most want to do is watch Netflix! In the present moment we are highly motivated by immediate rewards (for example watching TV or using our devices) and undervalue rewards that come in the future (for example, being well-rested or getting a good grade).</p><p>Some people can commit to a course of action that reduces future opportunities for procrastination or overconsumption. In behavioral economics, this is called <em>sophisticated behavior</em>. However, most of us are not Sophisticates. Most of us fail to realize that we will be tempted or will lack self-control in the future. We are called <em>Naivetes</em>. We say we’ll eat healthy, but when faced with a burger or salad, we opt for the burger.</p><p>Irrational Labs surveyed 900 people and asked them to imagine they were diagnosed with a disease that would require exact daily adherence to medication. Not adhering would put them at risk for severe health complications. 58% of the respondents said they would need no help in adhering to their medication perfectly. Research within hypertension, a diagnosis that requires strict adherence shows this is not the case. 50% of the people who are prescribed hypertension medication stop taking their medication entirely within the first year!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UV4XhjJYs-7UzBfZztPmOA.jpeg\" /></figure><p>So while people <em>want to take their meds regularly</em>, they do not predict that taking their medication will be difficult. Thus, they do not take action to put in place mechanisms that would help them better adhere to it.</p><p>The same can be said for device usage. Because people do not predict they will need help controlling device usage, they do not put in place self-control tools that could help manage usage. Some Sophisticates may add screen time limits, but most of us Naivetes do not. Furthermore, screen time limits, at least as currently designed in iOS, can be overruled. We’re given the option to choose: respect the limit we set or ignore it. Each instance of this taxes our self-control, which is a limited resource.</p><p>Given this, the biggest opportunity to move device usage in line with a user’s intentions falls on the designers of the systems. Behavioral science has shown that changing the environment can change behavior. Instead of convincing someone to eat less, make the plate smaller. Instead of convincing someone to care about their future, auto-enroll them into retirement savings. Instead of educating someone about eligibility requirements for federal financial aid for college, make the form easier to fill out or make it the norm to apply.</p><h3>Instead of convincing someone to use their device less, design the device so it is used less.</h3><p>Here’s an example — Interruptions are costly: it can take <a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf\">around 25 minutes</a> to get back on track with a task after an interruption. And even in a social context, interruptions are not ideal. It doesn’t feel good when the person we’re hanging out with keeps looking at her phone. So in theory, we should all put away our phones while we are working or when we’re socializing with others. But do we do this? No. <a href=\"https://getdaywise.com/\">Daywise</a> is an Android app that helps address the problem of notification interruptions.</p><p>Daywise batches notifications for you. Instead of getting a steady stream of notifications throughout the day, Daywise users receive notifications in a batched grouping. Most importantly, this system works. In a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-improve-smartphone-notifications-2018-4\">study</a> they ran in collaboration with Duke University, they found that batching notifications into 3 sets per day made people feel more productive, happier, more in control, and less stressed compared to a control group that did not have their notifications batched. Daywise understands the burden cannot fall on the individual and instead has designed a system that accounts for human nature.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wu_87AHbdah_RULNXdUo-w.jpeg\" /></figure><p>In the media, this issue of responsibility for digital wellbeing is sometimes being framed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/18/indistractable-control-attention-nir-eyal-review\">binary</a>: it’s either on the individual or it’s the responsibility of tech. We believe that it can and should be both, and we also believe that the system design has an outsized effect and should therefore be prioritized.</p><p>Let’s take an example from Johan Hari, who recently compared <a href=\"http://humanetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CHT-Undivided-Attention-Podcast-Ep.8-The-Opposite-of-Addiction.pdf\">people in Copenhagen vs. people in Lexington, KY.</a> The obesity rate is very low in Copenhagen and very high in Lexington. Is this a function of a significant difference in who these people fundamentally are? Do people in Copenhagen simply have much higher levels of self-control? Are people in Lexington just lazy? Of course not. Copenhagen is one of the best bicycle friendly-designed cities in the world, such that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/11/how-build-healthy-city-copenhagen-reveals-its-secrets-happiness\">most people there bike to work</a>. It’s just the easiest option for them. And healthy food is abundantly available. Lexington is the opposite: it’s set up for driving, and healthy food is hard to come by. Can someone in Lexington work hard to eat healthy food and get enough exercise? Of course.</p><h3>This is not a negation of individual agency and responsibility. It is a recognition, however, of the powerful effect that system design has.</h3><p>Just as city planners have a responsibility to think about how their city design and programs affect their citizens’ well-being, mobile apps and our current marketplaces (Google, Apple, Amazon) have the same responsibility to think about their users’ well-being.</p><p><em>Like what you read?

      "<p>The conventional path to business growth for product managers, designers, and marketers is to build rich features that exceed normal standards and then aggressively communicate the benefits of these features.</p><p>In this model, the key question a company must answer is, “How can we make users more aware of our product features and market differentiation?” This line of questioning has been the foundation of marketing textbooks and Silicon Valley handbooks for the last twenty years.</p><h3>Is this typical growth playbook correct?</h3><p>To get to the bottom of this mystery, researchers Fox, Hadar and Sood decided to study the difference between objective knowledge and <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265592160_Subjective_Knowledge_in_Consumer_Financial_Decisions\">subjective knowledge</a>. Objective knowledge is knowing how to do a thing. Subjective knowledge is <em>feeling</em> like you know how to do a thing.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Objective vs. Subjective Knowledge Example</em></strong><em><br />Someone who has high </em><strong><em>objective</em></strong><em> knowledge about cooking (turn oven to 350, check on food every 15 minutes until golden brown) could at the same time have low </em><strong><em>subjective</em></strong><em> knowledge, where they feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. Try giving a person low in subjective cooking knowledge a complex recipe. While the recipe will increase their objective knowledge (they now know how to cook a casserole), it may also decrease their subjective knowledge of cooking by drawing attention to how much they don’t know!</em></blockquote><h3>Which force is more powerful?</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nSdBfhIj5dBEikCx3ApvQw.png\" /></figure><p>The researchers ran a few clever experiments to figure out which force is more powerful in helping people take action? <strong><em>Objective vs subjective knowledge?</em></strong></p><p>For the first one, they provided participants the same basic facts about their retirement plan. Then, to manipulate subjective knowledge, the participants were asked either an easy question or a difficult one before enrollment. In theory, asking an easy or hard question shouldn’t have affected someone’s behavior. The retirement plan ROI did not change — it was the same plan regardless of the question. However, those who were asked the easy question were more willing to enroll in the plan than those asked the more difficult question. Why? The easy question increased their subjective knowledge, or “metacognitive feeling of knowing.”</p><p>In another clever study, the researchers manipulated the descriptions of mutual funds. Two groups of people received information about a mutual fund, but one group’s information included very technical words or phrases like “standard deviation” and “beta.”</p><p>All participants had completed multiple courses in economics and finance and were familiar with these terms. However, despite their expertise, the group exposed to the technical terms experienced a decrease in subjective knowledge — they felt less knowledgeable when reading the more technical description. This feeling translated into a decreased likelihood of choosing that fund.</p><h4><strong>Ultimately, the researchers found that investment decisions are influenced by subjective knowledge, independent of objective knowledge.</strong></h4><p>They said, “providing consumers with relevant but complex product information can sometimes enhance their objective level of knowledge while paradoxically diminishing their subjective level of knowledge.”</p><p>This means we may be more likely to make a decision when we feel confident about a decision versus simply informed. Likewise, if you want to get me (or your loved ones) to make a complex recipe vs. order take out, it’s not enough to give us the recipe and say GO! In fact, that approach would likely backfire. Instead, you may want to make me feel good about my current cooking knowledge. Compliments welcome. :)</p><p>More importantly, this conclusion calls into question the modern growth and marketing playbook for financial providers. Yes, people *should* know all the features of a retirement plan or financial product to get the optimal return, but knowing this may not actually influence their decision to invest. In fact, it may make us less likely to invest if it decreases our subjective knowledge!</p><h3><strong><em>What are the implications?</em></strong></h3><p>We live in a world that makes supplying objective knowledge a priority. Google, Yelp, Quora, and similar sites provide us with a stream of endless facts.

      "<h3>How Walmart coaxes us to buy things (for stuff we don’t really need)</h3><p>We just discovered the recipe for how Walmart gets us to buy things. And it’s not just low prices.</p><p>I kept my Walmart App notifications on between November 21st through December 9th. This time period is special because it includes Black Friday, Cyber Monday and, as I found out, Cyber Week and “12 Days of Deals.”</p><p>What you’re about to read actually happened — every time a deal ended, about 12 hours later another one started, using the same recipe. The Walmart mobile app averaged 3 notifications a day, each one following a very similar pattern.</p><p>The pattern leverages many of the key tenants of behavioral science — but times 100. While these patterns can be — and are — used for good — Walmart is very clearly using them to push us to buy things that we may not need. They are using their understanding of human psychology to grab our attention and twist it for their benefit and not ours.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/60/0*dCU4Xj4dxeQK4_D8\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*miwwGII2QUFlcNcU.png\" /></figure><h3>Let customers know the deals have started</h3><p>The first step is to tell customers about a new deal and what they should do. In this notification, Walmart very clearly tells me the deals have started and what I should do with this knowledge: “drop everything.”</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*X1sOv1ARPCQfOhbJ\" /></figure><h3>Tell me my time is running out</h3><p>The second step is a reminder. Knowing that I may not have been able to ‘drop everything’ at that moment, they give me a friendly warning that I should take them more seriously.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/0*kah_vNbMEZeZZVTo\" /></figure><h3>Extend the deadline</h3><p>After giving people a deadline, they extend the deadline. 12 hours later I get a notification that the deadline extended. Phew. Walmart probably knows I <em>wanted</em> to go shopping yesterday, but I just didn’t have the time.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/616/0*HYYJAwZh0IMEmlfM\" /></figure><h3>Remind me what their store sells</h3><p>This step is crucial. Walmart predicts that I forget what type of products they carry. So they remind me that they carry everything — and everything is on sale.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/616/0*9_NgCBIaLdxsvRkQ\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/616/0*FpvTiDQ_RrJyZr6y\" /></figure><h3>Tell me it’s about to end — again.</h3><p>Like last time, Walmart warns me when the end is coming. They extended Black Friday into the weekend, which was already super nice! But Sunday, it’s over. For real.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/0*ZIGLWJkfvXuoRPF1\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TVpLOPO2_0vO4CRh.png\" /></figure><h3>Let customers know the deals have started</h3><p>Like before, we know the first step of the recipe is to tell customers about a new deal and what they should do. It’s Cyber Monday. There are HOT deals! If I don’t act now, I may miss deals. I should obviously act now and start saving.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/678/0*8h1_AINw0b1B4n0N.png\" /></figure><p><em>Note: they skip extending the deadline this time and move straight to telling me about specific items</em></p><h3>Remind me what their store sells</h3><p>The crucial step — tell me about all the sales. Laptop, devices and more! Oh my! So many new deals.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/682/0*I1NgYzAJi0otZxnP.png\" /></figure><h3>Tell me it’s about to end — again.</h3><p>Never forget to warn me when the end is coming. I would have missed this deal without this notification. Phew.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/598/0*C_wWAykJpCTYbGRa.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Q1JlRbr6tNv1Rzis.png\" /></figure><h3>Let customers know the deals have started</h3><p>Back to basics: tell customers about a new deal and what they should do. It’s Cyber Week now! There is A WEEK of deals and I need to get them now.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/594/0*RyoitDhkFqxo4vsY.png\" /></figure><h3>Remind me what their store sells</h3><p>Crucial step. Walmart sells everything, and everything is on sale, but sometimes I do need that reminder.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/676/0*SGgXrgeYduoXcDtn.png\" /></figure><h3>Tell me it’s about to end — again.</h3><p>The warning has come. Hours left!? This has to be the <em>last chance </em>for deals. I can’t wait an entire year for them to return!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0ZUPW5WVUyxrVvqM.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XMiUBiehhsOEy8pA.png\" /></figure><h3>Let customers know the deals have started</h3><p>Back at it — as we now know, the first step is always to tell customers about a new deal and what they should do. This time it’s 12 days of deals! And, I need to “Shop Now.” Thanks, Walmart.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*z-4hNa55UiUGxCAH.png\" /></figure><p>—</p><p>At that point…I turned off notifications. We know how the “12 days of deals” is going to end — it won’t.</p><p>No wonder financial health in America is so bad. Everyone is up against Walmart-type marketing — and it’s an impossible fight to win. We’re being told we need a new device, new home furniture, new clothes, new video games. Who is telling us to spend within our budget? Or to buy<em> used </em>goods vs new? Or to stash some of our paycheck away for later?</p><p>Imagine if the Walmarts of the world used their notification system for good. They could send me multiple reminders to get my blood pressure checked at their health centers. They could develop a promotion that would motivate me to start a college savings account for my kids. They could put fruits and veggies on discount instead of fast fashion. “Act fast! These veggies are fresh but won’t be for long!” They could create a ‘sale period’ that nudged me to invest in books for myself or kids.</p><p>Sadly, we are getting yelled at to shop more, spend more, buy more from every direction — and this is the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>Yes, we should all just turn off our notifications. And thanks to Apple for trying to intervene (a little late, but you tried). But that’s not enough.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q7NXAvE7wDP38zHA.png\" /></figure><p>We need more norms to deter apps from sending these notifications in the first place and more policies to enforce a standard that is acceptable.</p><blockquote><em>If I don’t interact with a notification after 2 attempts, they should have a waiting period to re-contact me.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>They shouldn’t be able to send more than 2(?) notifications a day without additional permission from me.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>We should limit the hours they can reach us. Telemarketers, </em><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-telemarketing-sales-rule\"><em>among other restrictions</em></a><em>, are limited to calls between 8am and 9pm.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>We should be able to report apps that are abusive to some central governance body that monitors complaints. Imagine if Google and Apple App Stores responded to these complaints by demoting the abuser in their app store.</em></blockquote><p>There are hundreds of mobile apps that <em>do help us in a significant way.</em> This is not an attack on digital products or even notifications in general. Many notifications are incredibly valuable and helpful to us. This is a callout to companies that are bad actors in our evolving mobile ecosystem.</p><p>The world is getting noisier and in an attempt to capture our attention, companies amp up the volume. The scary thing is not when one app crosses the line, but that one app crossing the line will influence others to do the same. How will app developers compete if their competitors are sending 3 notifications a day and they are only sending 1? They will compete by sending 4. It’s a slippery slope.</p><p>In general, a system that sends us three notifications a day for weeks on end, yelling at us to buy more and more and more is not set up to make us happier or financially better off. It’s set up to make the Walmarts of the world more money.</p><p><em>This is how it looks to have Walmart notifications turned on:</em></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8NAGjyTig5f655_hIn1AsQ.png\" /><figcaption>This is how it looks to have Walmart notifications turned on</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/739/0*EbESs_m8kIHLtn-e\" /><figcaption>This is how it looks to have Walmart notifications turned on</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vrmDlmXCkhK15nlNXLxSMA.png\" /><figcaption>This is how it looks to have Walmart notifications turned on</figcaption></figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a403f954a85d\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/behavioral-economics-1/how-walmart-coaxes-us-to-buy-things-for-stuff-we-dont-need-a403f954a85d\">How Walmart coaxes us to buy things (for stuff we don’t need)</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/behavioral-economics-1\">Hacking Behavior</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>~\n",

Anecdotally, the cities that seem have a number of high quality founders and new companies - and therefore may be on their way to growing more unicorns include Denver and Salt Lake City.

While Bangalore continues to thrive, some point to bad governance locally (traffic, high rents, passive government) as one of the reasons it is not the only center.

Obviously, something else may be afoot.</div><div><br /></div><div>San Francisco should be going through a golden era and boom. It could be one of the great cities of the world, with a large city budget to support it. Unfortunately, San Francisco's poor governance, high cost of living,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_housing_shortage\">lack of housing</a>, failed homeless services, <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Amid-1-7-billion-city-deficit-SF-health-15347798.php\">bad budget controls</a>, and other issues were prominent before COVID. With a never-lifted lockdown the city has continued to <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/heatherknight/article/Two-deaths-a-day-S-F-drug-overdoses-fueled-by-15635199.php\">degrade</a> and this is reflected in both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/a-true-emergency-covid-19-pushes-homeless-crisis-in-san-franciscos-tenderloin-to-the-brink\">homeless situation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/S-F-rent-prices-plunge-as-much-as-31-15644663.php\">dropping rent prices as people move out </a>of the city.</div><div><br /></div><div>The smoke and fires was a recent last straw that drove a set of young unmarried founders I know out of the Bay Area. Anecdotally these founders have largely temporarily relocated to New York and Los Angeles. The main reason people stay in SF is the social network and the serendipity of a cluster and network effect. Due to SIP, if you can not meet people in person there is no impetus to put up with poor living conditions and to stay put. Many have decided to go to cities that are more liveable, with less restrictive conditions.</div><div><br /></div><div>In parallel, a number of later stage startup CEOs are interested in hiring more outside of the Bay Area, and especially outside of San Francisco. There is an increasing perception that San Francisco based hires are more expensive, self-entitled, and political-activism-at-work oriented (versus core company mission &amp; performance focused) than employees elsewhere. Of course, not all late stage founders share this perspective but an accelerating number do. This impacts early stage companies less with their smaller employee bases, tightly defined missions, and existential need to ship.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>If the Bay Area does eventually decrease as a cluster, I am guessing it will be only a partial decline. <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2019/06/industry-towns-where-you-start-company.html\">The network effects and talent base in the Bay Area </a>are incredibly high and if diminished I would guess would drop by 10-20% not 80%. That said, New York, Los Angeles, and to a lessor extent Denver, seem positioned to grow in importance over time if COVID SIP extends indefinitely or SF takes an aggressive tax stance or continues on its governance slide. While I am long term bullish on the Bay Area as an ongoing home for unicorns and major US cluster, it is worth watching how ongoing governance and policies will impact SF. Only time will tell.&nbsp;</div><div><p style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\"><span face=\"Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 14.85px;\"><b>SOURCES</b></span></p><p style=\"background-color: white;\"></p><p style=\"background-color: white;

      "<p>Over the last few years there has been a lot of press coverage of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html\">Google canceling project Maven</a>, a defense contract. This has led to claims Silicon Valley is no longer engaging in defense tech, despite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://steveblank.com/secret-history/\">tech's roots working with the Department of Defense</a> and other government agencies. Things like the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c0152d2-d0f2-11e2-be7b-00144feab7de\">Internet, various semiconductor companies, and GPS/location services are all outgrowths of defense-related work</a>.</p><p>It turns out that despite the popular narrative, companies both large and small have continued to work with the government. Indeed, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/jedi-why-we-will-continue-protest-politically-corrupted-contract-award/\">Amazon and Microsoft are publicly fighting</a> over a major contract with the DoD called JEDI. Other companies such as <a href=\"https://qz.com/1461910/these-companies-are-pitching-ai-to-the-us-military/\">Intel, IBM, and Oracle</a> have long standing defense relationships. <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/government/resources/cloud-computing-dod-approved-software-list/\">Salesforce has long had a \"Government Cloud\"</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/government/overview/defense/\">DoD ATO approvals</a>.</p><p>A few years ago, I thought new DefenseTech would largely consist of specialist companies like <a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/\">Anduril</a>, whose primary focus is defense (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-virtual-border-wall/2020/07/02/7b380490-b0ac-11ea-a567-6172530208bd_story.html\">Anduril recently landed a $250 million, 5 year contract with DHS</a>&nbsp;as well as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/military-tech/marine-corps-anduril-industries-palmer-luckey-contract\">$13.5 million Marine Corps contract</a>). I have long thought there is room for an AI/ML-centric software only defense contractor.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that, in addition to defense-first companies like Anduril or Shield.AI, many of the companies recently landing large government contracts are tech companies that do not have defense as their primary vertical. The current generation of new defense tech companies look similar to the prior generation of defense tech companies - they are simply the leading companies of their broader respective areas selling technology to multiple markets including defense. Despite all the punditry claiming the opposite, <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2020/07/silicon-valley-giants-not-start-ups-dominate-dod-tech/\">mainstream Silicon Valley remains quite active</a> in serving the defense world.&nbsp;</p><p>Specialist firms like Anduril will continue to thrive. However there turns out to be a lot of room for standard tech companies to add defense as an important vertical market. Some examples of private non-defense tech companies working with national defense:</p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><a href=\"https://www.appliedintuition.com/\"><b>Applied Intuition</b></a>. Applied Intuition's core business is with autonomous vehicle companies. However its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/12/applied-intuition-raises-40-million-for-autonomous-vehicle-simulation-tools/\">simulation infrastructure software</a>&nbsp;is being used in multiple defense mobility applications.</li><li><b><a href=\"https://www.palantir.com/\">Palantir</a></b>. Palantir has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/\">won an $876 million deal</a>&nbsp;with the DoD. Their business includes fintech, healthcare (NIH and CDC), and other applications. [Note: Palantir went public while I was writing this post].</li><li><b><a href=\"https://Scale.AI\">Scale.AI</a>. </b>Scale provides labelled data sets for machine learning applications across multiple verticals and is used by Airbnb, SAP, Pinterest, DoorDash and others. <a href=\"https://www.govconwire.com/2020/09/scale-ai-gets-potential-91m-army-contract-to-support-annotated-dataset-devt-effort/\">They recently signed a $91 million Army contract</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.skydio.com/\"><b>Skydio</b></a>. Skydio started off as a consumer drone company only to quickly find enterprise applications in public safety and inspection. More recently it has also added&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skydio.com/pages/defense\">defense</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/\"><b>SpaceX</b></a>. Elon Musk's SpaceX has signed a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-spacex-wins-pentagon-missile-tracking-satellite-contract-2020-10\">$145 million contract with the Pentagon&nbsp;</a>to build missile tracking satellites. SpaceX has also signed contract with the DoD <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/musks-spacex-partners-us-military-to-deliver-weapons-by-rockets-2020-10\">to develop rockets with different defense cargo payloads</a>. Existing incumbent solutions (the C-17 rockets) cost $200M each.</li><li><b>Tons of SaaS companies</b>. Most SaaS companies eventually end up with the government as customers.

      "<p>Over the life of a startup, 3 archetypes are needed to found, build, and scale a company. It is rare to find someone who is a 10X version of one of these archetypes, so even rarer to find someone who captures 2 or 3 of them. As such, usually these characteristics are divided into 3 or more people who are uniquely good at their core function.</p><p><b>Archtype 1: Ability to <u>Sell</u>. </b>Apple example:&nbsp;Steve Jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Every startup needs someone who is great at selling. This founder convinces people to join the company, gets the first few customers, and pulls off the impossible partnership or ridiculous fundraise.

While some founders end up as excellent operators, often they need to hire someone who is their complement to learn from or to drive much of the scaling. These professional executives tend to be great at people issues but bad at making bold or controversial decisions or iterating on the next wave of disruption. This is why they are able to climb the corporate ladder and work with stubborn decisive founders, but also is why they are not usually founders themselves.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ij2O2t2stQ4/X3tqzXk30SI/AAAAAAAAHlM/CZf5mPblY4w9PbAohzaECfaCml96bVtKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s620/tim-cook.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ij2O2t2stQ4/X3tqzXk30SI/AAAAAAAAHlM/CZf5mPblY4w9PbAohzaECfaCml96bVtKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tim-cook.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><p><b>Founders &amp; Archetypes.</b></p><p>Many of the best founders are good at 1 &amp; 2 (Sell &amp; Build) but not great at 3 (Scale). This is often a mix of experience (if you are a founder you are unlikely to have run a multi-thousand person organization in the past) and personality (impatience or raw cussedness or other traits that may help with early success may not always lend themselves well to every managerial situation). Some founders do well out of raw product/market fit and may not actually be great at any of the archetypes - although often these companies never quite reach their real potential. The founders I have seen build companies that reach their biggest potential have a spike in at least one, or potentially 2, archetypes. Some founders also eventually learn to scale, or get smart enough about hiring great people who provide scaling that it is equivalent to the same thing.</p><p><b>Archetypes and CEO transitions.</b></p><p>Founders tend to appreciate people who are complementary to them and can help scale their company. The first time a capable, experienced executive is hired is a magical moment for a founder. It turns out you can delegate all sorts of things to people who are better at it then you!</p><p>This leads to many professional operators taking over as CEO when a founder steps down[1]. The operator had scaled the company, gets along well with the founder to whom they tend to defer, and are great at running a tight ship. Unfortunately, the professional operator CEO often tend to avoid controversy, disruption, bold new product moves, and the ability to do something high risk or contrarian. Often the company will coast on prior products and do well for many years, only to get hit and destroyed by a new disruption or company.</p><p>One of the big mistakes successful founders tend to make late in the life of a company is to promote to CEO someone who is a different archetype from themselves, instead of looking for someone just like them. When stepping down from a major company built over a lifetime, it might be wiser to look for a founder type with Sell and Build archetype characteristics over a Scale archetype executive. Or, to at least look for a Scale archetype who has had a strong Build experience and aptitude.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>[1] It is important to differentiate between CEO transitions earlier in the life of a company versus later. For example, if a founder has a great 20-30 year run and built a tens of billions company, this is the exact moment they may want more of a \"founder\" than a \"scaler\" as CEO. If, instead, the company has built an initial product but needs help executing, building sales etc and the founder is not up for the journey, it might make sense to just hire a \"scaler\" to get the company back on track (so that it survives). Like all things startuo-related, there is a lot of room for context and nuance on this.</p><p style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif;

      "<p>During the first social era as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and other products were first breaking out, there was a lot of talk of the \"social enterprise\" or \"<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-rise-of-the-networked-enterprise-web-20-finds-its-payday\">networked enterprise</a>\". The idea, circa 2010, was that all the collaborative features of Web 2.0 social products were going to be baked into SaaS leading to large scale transformation of software. This obviously did not happen 10 years ago.</p><p>More recently, the two big trends transforming the enterprise are (i) <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2019/01/interesting-markets-2019-edition.html\">Nocode/Lowcode/RPA</a>, and the (ii) Collaborative Enterprise[1]. Collaborative enterprise is an updated take on building collaboration and learnings from consumer products into SaaS.&nbsp;</p><p>The emergence of collaborative products in the enterprise is being driven by a handful of trends:</p><p><b>A. User shift.&nbsp;</b>Users (and founders) who grew up with social product, chat, cloud storage, and lots of cloud apps are comfortable with using similar products in the enterprise. Adoption of basic team communication and collaboration tools have now been massively accelerated with COVID. COVID is a new \"why now\" statement for many companies in this area.</p><p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DXMAvkM-vOU/X3Md4NLAitI/AAAAAAAAHjg/Ld5mH5f-yiw2gJls5vG2ZAzAhiJs53aTQCLcBGAsYHQ/s650/msft%2Bteams.jpeg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DXMAvkM-vOU/X3Md4NLAitI/AAAAAAAAHjg/Ld5mH5f-yiw2gJls5vG2ZAzAhiJs53aTQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h296/msft%2Bteams.jpeg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GoB1R5bUU3Y/X3Mef_998RI/AAAAAAAAHj0/bh_XcWQke_sxgAeJcgOq6E6qoqHImyqJwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1916/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-09-29%2Bat%2B4.44.41%2BAM.png\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GoB1R5bUU3Y/X3Mef_998RI/AAAAAAAAHj0/bh_XcWQke_sxgAeJcgOq6E6qoqHImyqJwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h376/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-09-29%2Bat%2B4.44.41%2BAM.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br /></div><p></p><p><b>B. Distribution shift. </b>Bottoms-up adoption and in-product viral and growth distribution techniques have at last been integrated into SaaS products. In-product distribution techniques are inherently focused on collaboration, so some of the earliest features in many products are peer-to-peer or network driven. Box and Dropbox are examples of early pioneers of these techniques, with Slack similarly adopting early in product-distribution techniques.</p><p>In the past, many large enterprises were locked down by IT and legal in terms of what could be downloaded or used by an individual in the enterprise. Given the platform shift below, much more can be done in browser now than in the past, opening up broader opportunities.</p><p><b>C. Tech shift.&nbsp;</b>WebRTC and WebGL are now baked properly into browsers - this creates a platform shift that is enabling applications rich in audio, video, and collaborative graphics. Browser based audio/video are finally crisp and products like Figma work seamlessly in real time in part due to WebGL. This tech stack also has implications to social products (discuss in another post).</p><p>The emergence of the collaborative enterprise is going to yield a number of companies across categories. Below is a list of potential categories in which large collaborative enterprise products may emerge:</p><p><b>1.&nbsp;</b><b>Collaborative Enterprise:&nbsp;</b><b>Function-Specific Tools</b></p><p>These are team-oriented tasks or products in which multiple people work together to product an end product like a user interface design, BI graph interpretation, FP&amp;A planning, or other areas. Here are some example areas: (Lists below are non-comprehensive - apologies for any omissions this post was written quickly)</p><p></p><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Design.</b> <a href=\"http://figma.com\" target=\"_blank\">Figma</a> was a forerunner on the collaborative enterprise with its best-in-class cloud-based collaboration focused design tools and early adoption of WebGL. <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\">Invision's</a> first products were similarly focused on team collaboration in the cloud. <a href=\"https://zeplin.io/\">Zeplin</a> was focused early on on design-to-engineering hand offs. Sketch and others are now scrambling to catch up. Figma has emerged as the leader in core design on the web.</li><li><b>Engineering.&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">Gitlab</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://github.com\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>&nbsp;are the grandparent apps in this category. A number of engineering collaboration and productivity tools are also being built. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://withfig.com/\">Fig</a> for the terminal.</li><li><b>FP&amp;A.</b> A number of startups are emerging with a focus on collaborative financial planning, headcount planning, and other tasks that tend to be cross-functional, currently run in a spreadsheet, and highly inefficient otherwise. Comp<span style=\"background-color: white;\">anies <span>include <a href=\"http://Runway.com\">Runway.com</a>, <a href=\"http://Pigment.so\">Pigment.so</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cubesoftware.com/\">Cube</a>.</span></span></li><li><b>Business intelligence &amp; Dashboards</b>. Focused on sharable graphs, commenting, and interactions for BI applications, companies include <a href=\"https://Graphyapp.com\">Graphyapp.com</a>, <a href=\"https://mode.com/\">Mode</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sigmacomputing.com/\">Sigma</a>.</li><li><b>Data science. </b>A number of tools have emerged recently for collaborative data science. <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter Notebooks</a> was an early pioneer in this area with <a href=\"https://deepnote.com/\">Deepnote</a> a more recent entrant and <a href=\"https://www.streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> taking a very different approach focused on creating data apps.</li><li><b>Other areas.</b> Many other areas are finally allowing for in-browser collaboration and cloud hosted output.</li></ul><div><b>2.&nbsp;</b><b>Collaborative Enterprise:&nbsp;</b><b>Remote Work, Events, &amp; Distributed teams.&nbsp;</b></div><div><br /></div><div>In addition to vertical or task-specific tools, there is also emergence of better tools for remote work, collaboration, events, and networking including:</div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>The basics.</b>&nbsp;</li><ul><li><b>Communication.</b> Besides some of the vertical/functional tooling mentioned above (e.g. Github/Gitlab, Figma etc.) <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a>, <a href=\"https://meet.google.com/\">Google Meet,</a> <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>/<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\">Microsoft Teams</a>, form the basics of communication for remote work. Newer companies like <a href=\"https://tandem.chat/\">Tandem</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://Around.co\">Around.co</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://threads.com/\">Threads</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://quill.chat/\">Quill</a> are also working in this area.</li><li><b>Productivity &amp; emergence of NoCode/LowCode</b></li><ul><li>Cloud based versions of productivity suite tools are accelerating. This include Docs (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/docs/about/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a>, <a href=\"https://coda.io/welcome\">Coda</a>, to a lesser extent <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam</a>), Spreadsheet/Access (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">Airtable</a>) and slides (<a href=\"https://pitch.com/\">Pitch</a>). The new entrants like Airtable and Notion are <i>dramatically</i> more interesting than their Google cloud based predecessors.</li><li>Unlike their productivity suite predecessors, the NoCode platforms are actually broader-based tools to allow any person at an organization to build an application or capture knowledge collaboratively. For example, <a href=\"https://airtable.com/templates\">Airtable</a>&nbsp;allows people to build simple software applications, or to use templated applications for their own work flow or productivity. You can think of this as taking a SQL database or excel spreadsheet and turning it into an app platform.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/templates\">Airtable has templates</a>&nbsp;for everything from Applicant Tracking Systems to Marketing Forms to CRM.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a>&nbsp;(which is more docs-based, knowledge capture, and productivity-centric)&nbsp;has templates for design systems, knowledge capture, note taking, and other areas. These companies are building a few of the key bases for the future of collaboration in the enterprise.</li><li>(Aside: there are obviously also vertical NoCode/LowCode apps outside of productivity (e.g. <a href=\"https://retool.com/\">Retool</a> et al), and RPA or automation products (<a href=\"https://parabola.io/\">Parabola</a>&nbsp;et al) which will be covered in a separate post.)</li></ul></ul><li><b>Cloud storage. </b><a href=\"https://www.box.com/\">Box</a>, <a href=\"https://dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a>, and Google Drive are obvious early examples of early collaborative enterprise tools, that are now used ~ubiquitously.</li><li><b>Virtual office. </b>A number of companies are experimenting with providing a virtual space for people to hang out and collaborate. This includes companies like <a href=\"http://Huddlehq.io\">Huddlehq.io</a>, and <a href=\"http://With.so\">With.so</a>, <a href=\"http://Here.fm\">Here.fm</a>.</li><li><b>Virtual conference room. </b>I think a virtual conference room product is going to emerge and scale rapidly. One could argue products like <a href=\"https://miro.com/\">Miro</a>, which focus on virtual white boards, project planning, and kanban boards, are the early precursors for what will likely be video enabled, tightly integrated products. This may be solved by the virtual office products above, by products like Miro, by Zoom or others integrating collaboration tools, or an entirely new company.</li><li><b>Virtual events.</b>&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Once COVID is over, many events will snap back to the real world. However, social distancing has also shown the value of remote events - more people will attend virtually (in some cases 10X-100X more), there is no need for travel and wasted time, and sometimes the format is more efficient.&nbsp;</li><li>The downside is the loss of serendipity and side conversations. This leads to virtual networking products (including a side project I am experimenting with).</li><li>Companies for virtual events include <a href=\"http://Hopin.to\">Hopin.to</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://experiencewelcome.com\">Welcome</a>, <a href=\"https://gatherly.io/\">Gatherly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eventmobi.com/\">EventMobi</a>, and others. I expect one or more of these to be worth many billions in the future.</li></ul><li><b>Virtual networking.</b> There are two types of virtual networking - networking at an event or a social hour, and meeting people 1:1 to expand your network. Companies have arisen for both purposes including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.airmeet.com/\">Airmeet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.runtheworld.today/\">Run The World</a>&nbsp;(see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBmMU_iwe6U\">also</a>), <a href=\"http://Toucan.events\">Toucan.events</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://Rally.video\">Rally.video</a>&nbsp;for the former, and <a href=\"https://lunchclub.ai/\">Lunchclub</a> for the later.</li></ul></div><p></p><p>While many of the areas above are speculative, the movement to truly collaborative tooling for the business world is one of the two new big paradigm shifts for enterprises after the cloud (the other being Nocode/Lowcode/RPA). The Collaborative Enterprise is finally coming, and it is coming fast due to shifts in technology, user behavior, and bottoms up distribution.</p><p><b>NOTES</b></p><p>[1] To coin a term, badly.</p><p><b style=\"background-color: white;

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Just as every founder seems to have a side angel fund, every late stage investor now appears to have a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company). While SPACs have existed outside of tech for decades (largely to help slower growth profitable companies go public), SPACs are now entering the tech ecosystem. SPACs in tech were pioneered early by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chamath\">Chamath Palihapitaya</a>, who used one to take <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-space-spac%3A-everything-you-need-to-know-about-virgin-galactic-2019-10-28\">Virgin Galactic public</a>. More recent SPACs have been raised by funds like <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-24/dragoneer-joins-blank-check-craze-with-600-million-u-s-listing\">Dragoneer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/29/why-goldman-sachs-just-raised-700-million-for-a-ne.aspx\">Goldman Sachs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/bill-ackmans-pershing-square-wants-to-raise-4-billion-for-its-spac-51594665016\">Pershing Square</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/68296/Barry-Sternlichts-SPAC-Jaws-Acquisition-increases-unit-offering-by-25-ahead\">Barry Sternlicht's Jaws</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/07/31/eventbrite-co-founder-files-for-blank-check-ipo.html\">Eventbrite's Kevin Hartz</a>.<br /><br />At its core, you can think of SPACs as decentralized investment banking - SPACs are roughly public search funds that allow individuals or funds to take private companies public.<br /><br />Given <a href=\"https://spacdata.com/\">all the capital raised by SPACs</a>, it seems likely a number of technology companies will be acquired by SPACs as a mechanism to raise more capital and go public in the next 12-24 months.<br /><br />This post reviews how SPACs work, where incentives lie, and how SPACs compare to Direct Listings (DLs) and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://growth.eladgil.com/book/chapter-8-financing-and-valuation/ipos-taking-a-company-public/\">IPOs</a>. The emphasis of this post is tech-centric SPACs, versus the original usage.<br /><br /><b>What is a SPAC?</b><br />A SPAC is a shell company that raises money by going public via an IPO, with the goal of merging with a private company within 18-24 months as a way of taking the private company public (without an IPO). The SPAC raises money from public market investors which is then part of the merged entity. For example, a SPAC could raise $500 million in a public listing, and then 6 months later \"acquire\" a private tech unicorn. The unicorn now has an incremental $500 million (either in primary investment and/or existing shareholders could have sold stock), is a public company, and may keep a subset of the directors of the SPAC as its directors.<br /><br /><b>A SPAC is composed of:</b><br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>The owners of the SPAC. </b>Often the SPAC is associated with a venture fund, crossover fund, or other institutional capital platform. The owners of the SPAC put up a % of the SPAC capital to cover investment banking and other costs, as well as raise the money for the SPAC via the IPO. The owners of the SPAC are also putting their vote of confidence behind the target company acquired.</li><li><b>The operators of the SPAC.</b> As a public shell company, the SPAC has a CEO and a board of directors. The task of the CEO, a small operating team, and the board is to find a company to acquire or merge with. In some cases the directors of the SPAC are deeply involved with the search and later operations of the target. In other cases, the SPAC directors are window dressing to legitimize the SPAC and make it easier to raise money or acquire targets. The owners of the SPAC and operators of the SPAC often overlap substantially.</li><li><b>The investors in the SPAC. </b>Often public market investors, the SPAC investors have some say in who the SPAC merges with. In particular the SPAC investor can choose to redeem their capital (i.e. get it back) if they do not approve a merger. This means the SPAC owners need to get buy in from the SPAC investors to actually \"acquire\" the target company. This means many SPACs end up with a 3-way negotiation on valuation, governance, and other items between the owners &amp; operators of the SPAC, the investors in the SPAC, and the target private company.</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Timeline for SPACs</b><br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Setup. </b>SPACs are quick to set up as (i) they are a shell company without an underlying operating business or projections and (ii) most people running SPACs have ties to crossover or public market investors and investment bankers so can raise SPAC money quickly. Most SPACs take a few months to set up.</li><li><b>Target acquisition.</b> SPACs are usually required to find a private target company to acquire within 18-24 months. The people who own and operate the SPAC typically want a longer time to find a target, while the SPAC investors prefer their capital not be tied up indefinitely and want a shorter timeline.</li></ul><br /><b>Finding a target to acquire</b><br />SPACs tend to target companies whose valuation is roughly 3-5X the size of the SPAC. For example, a $500 million SPAC may seek targets that are worth $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in size. This is not a hard and fast rule and there may be a larger range driven by the capital needs or secondary interest of a private company and its owners.<br /><br />Once a SPAC is public, it has 18 to 24 months to find a private company to \"acquire\". This search is driven by a mix of investment banker ideas, relationships the SPAC owners and operators have, and a search done by the SPAC operators. Most SPACs are in the $300M to $1 billion range, which limits the types of companies that make sense for a SPAC to work with. In general a company needs to have at least $500M in market cap, and usually is quite larger, for a SPAC to make sense.<br /><br /><b>The negotiation</b><br />The negotiation will largely be between the private tech company and the SPAC.<br /><br />The SPAC negotiation may include terms such as:<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Valuation. </b>What is the price of the target company?</li><li><b>Governance.</b> What will the board look like post SPACing? Other terms?</li><li><b>Primary versus secondary. </b>What portion of the SPAC will go to buy out existing shareholders versus is new capital into the company itself? Will there be a follow on investment such as a PIPE (see below)?</li><li><b>Liquidity. </b>Under what terms can insiders in the private company sell stock? Is there a lockup or other constraints? Unlike an IPO (where bankers, not regulators, ask for the 6 months lockup, SPACs can acquire the tech company and immediately start trading the stock).</li><li><b>Warrant coverage. </b>Early SPACs included the ability for the SPAC owners to buy shares cheaply from the target company, in parallel to the SPAC itself merging with it.</li></ul>(As an aside: the SPAC may more rarely negotiate with its investors to prevent them from redeeming their capital if they do not like the deal. In most SPACs, the investors can ask for their money back if they do not approve of the acquisition. Some SPACs, like Bill Ackmans, have complex structures in place to deal with redemptions but that will not be covered here. There is also a negotiation between the SPAC and PIPE investors, if a PIPE is also done (see below))<br /><br /><b>Raising more money via a PIPE</b><br />In addition to the money raised by the SPAC via its own IPO, a SPAC can also raise more money as part of acquiring its target in what is known as a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity). This is a fancy way of saying they can raise more money with special terms for private investors. The follow on PIPE can be quite a bit larger then the original SPAC and allow for acquisitions of bigger private companies or better capitalization of a business if needed.<br /><br />The PIPE can also offset redemptions - for example if half of a SPACs investors do not want to participate in a deal and they redeem their capital, more money can be raised to offset this via a PIPE.<br /><br /><b>Economics and incentives</b><br />The SPAC owners put up the \"at risk\" capital of the SPAC and in exchange reap an economic bounty if the SPAC works. While each SPAC is unique, the terms of the SPAC roughly include:<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>At-risk capital. </b>The SPAC owners will put up on the order of $5M to $10M minimum to cover SPAC expenses and investment banking fees to take the SPAC public, perform the search, pay the operators and directors etc. If the SPAC never buys a target, this money is lost.</li><li><b>Upside.</b>&nbsp;SPAC owners typically receive 20% of the equity of the SPAC. For example, if you raise a $500M SPAC, you may receive $100M of the value when the SPAC buys its target. In some cases hurdles are inserted - for example \"you only receive 20% of the value over a 8% a year internal rate of return (IRR).</li><li><b>Warrants</b>. In addition to the SPAC upside, the SPAC owners traditionally have negotiated additional warrant coverage with the target company they acquired. Early SPACs had 1:1 warrant coverage (i.e. they could buy one share at a steep discount for every share the SPAC bought in the private company). More recent SPACs have reduced this ratio to 1:5 and it will likely go away as higher quality companies use SPACs to effectively go public.</li></ul><br /><b>Differences from an IPO or Direct Listing</b><br />Because a SPAC buying a target is an acquisition versus an IPO, the regulatory rules and banking asks differ quite a bit. This includes:<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Pricing. </b>The price of the private company going public is set in negotiation between the SPAC and the target (and in some sense the SPAC and its own investors who can redeem a deal they do not like). This differs substantially from a typical IPO in which bankers set pricing, often with both the company and their own incentives in mind.</li><li><b>Liquidity. </b>The 6-month lock up around an IPO is a contractual term put in by investment bankers when they take a company public, not regulators. In a SPAC acquisition, who can sell what shares when is completely open to negotiation between the SPAC and the target. For example, insiders could sell immediately, be locked up partially or fully for different periods of times, and you can even differentially lock up different people or investors. This provides enormous flexibility. In a direct listing, only existing shareholders can sell and a company is not allowed to raise money itself for some period after the direct listing. Often, a company doing a direct listing will raise money in advance of the listing, as well as organize a large secondary sale of existing employees and investors to soak up internal demand to sell its stock in advance of listing on an exchange. This serves to keep the stock price stable.</li><li><b>Capital raised. </b>The capital injected into the private company by a SPAC is a mix of the amount of money the SPAC raised plus any PIPEs. The now public SPAC-target hybrid could also raise money directly after the merger. This is similar to an IPO where capital can be raised via IPO as well as via a follow on offering. Direct Listings, in contrast, do not allow primary capital to be raised immediately following listing.</li><li><b>Banker involvement.</b>&nbsp;Bankers are involved with taking the SPAC public, as well as the merger with the private target company. However bankers do not set the terms of liquidity or the price of the IPO.</li><li><b>Roadshow.</b> For a traditional IPO there is typically a 2 week roadshow where the company execs fly around the country pitching the company in 30 minute meetings to institutional investors. In a direct listing, a single \"investor day\" is often done instead, where potential investors can dial in. For a SPAC, the company executives may meet with major SPAC shareholders. However, no formal process is required.</li><li><b>Information and projections. </b>In order to public via a SPAC, the target company needs to have audited financial information. Given that the SPAC-target tie up is a merger, rather than an initial public offering, there are fewer regulatory constraints on the ability to share projections or other information. In particular, unlike an IPO a SPAC can provide forward looking projections and guidance for the asset it merges with.</li><li><b>Brand.</b>&nbsp;In the finance world, SPACs have traditionally had a second tier brand. The companies that used SPACs prior to the recent tech wave were often seen as the less interesting or weaker companies. This may change given the types of investors who have raised SPACs, and the technology companies likely to effectively go public via a merger with said SPACs.</li></ul><br /><b>Future of SPACs</b><br />SPACs have raised a bolus of capital recently. Will SPACs become a mainstream mechanism for the best technology startups to go public? Will SPACs become more attractive to companies by lowering sponsor cut (Pershing Square is taking a sponsor fee largely driven by performance and earn outs, likely yielding around 6% of the post-merger entity), lowering warrants, and getting a few high quality companies to buy in? Or will SPAC be the 2020 version of ICOs - lots of activity that will enrich a handful of sponsors but be a secondary use case? The coming 2 years will determine a lot of this outcome.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gokulr\">Gokul Rajaram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/steckenrider/\">Troy Steckenrider</a> for feedback on this post.<br /><br /><b style=\"background-color: white;

Like dominos slowing falling over there is a cascade of hiring freezes, purchasing freezes and layoffs. The companies whose customers did purchasing freezes or cost cuts suddenly find their own revenue dropping, so they too need to decrease costs in headcount and/or purchasing.<br /><br />Right now big enterprises have been going through the following steps:<br />1. Figure out this COVID thing. (1-2 weeks)<br />2. Figure out how to get 10,000 people to work from home and become somewhat productive. (4 weeks)<br />3. Figure out impact of economic slowdown to our business and customers (2-4 weeks)<br />4. Decide how to cut costs and pull together layoff plan (4 weeks)<br />5. Take action like layoffs, IT buying freeze etc. (4-8 weeks)<br /><br />In other words, it should take a large enterprise 3-6 months to move to remote work, understand its financial situation, plan a layoff and buying freeze, and execute it. Given that we are only a month or two into COVID, much of the damage is yet to come. This means many startups won't see the real impact of the slow down for anywhere between a few weeks and two quarters as big enterprises figure it all out and then act.<br /><br />As more people become unemployed (many economists estimate 20-30% unemployment) and consumer demand drops, more large enterprises will take the following actions:<br />1. Slow or freeze purchasing<br />2. Renegotiate prices or contracts &amp; backend payments<br />3. Freeze hiring or do layoffs<br />4. Divest assets or divisions<br />5. Some will also be aggressive and start doing more M&amp;A or market consolidation<br /><br />As a startup you will need to make a series of offensive and defensive moves to deal with this new environment.<br /><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />If you are an early stage company that has raised 2-3 years of cash, you may be fine and can ignore a lot of the advice below. Your focus should be on building a team and product that will get to product/market fit in today's environment. The main suggestion would be to focus on a product that can sell in a year when your product is ready - the biggest risk for an early stage company is that sales cycles may take longer.<br /><br />For everyone else, read on :)<br /><br /><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Defensive Moves</span></b><br /><b>1. Check your cash burn.&nbsp;</b><br />Assess your situation:<br />How much cash do you have?<br />What is happening to your business?<br />What is likely to happen given customer mix?<br /><br />You need to figure out how to get to 2 to 3 years of cash. 3 is optimal as it gives you:<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>6-12 months for the economy to bottom</li><li>6-12 months to adjust and start to grow again. You will need to show growth to fundraise at a good price.</li><li>9-12 months of buffer when you go out to fundraise</li></ul><br />Getting to 2-3 years may include fundraising, pricing or payment changes with customers, or cutting your own costs via layoffs or other means.<br /><br />In planning burn you should assume also do a \"stress test\" model. For example, if you planned to grow 3X this year, what happens if you grow 2X? If you are flat with the year? If you are down 50%? Some businesses are actually accelerating out of COVID and this might not be relevant. If you are already seeing things slow you might want to see what a low probability, worst case plan means for cash management as the economic picture unfolds during the next 2 quarters.<br /><br /><b>2. Raising money in a recession.</b><br />There is an old saying in fundraising \"when they are passing the&nbsp;hors d'oeuvres take two\" - when money is available you should take it. Fundraising in a recession is different from fundraising in good times.<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Optimize for an OK valuation and speed versus a great valuation and slow process.</b> Valuations that look cheap in a given moment may look expensive 6 months later during volatile times. In good times you should optimize for valuation. In bad times, you should optimize for speed, simplicity, and buffer.</li><li><b>Take a bit of extra money.</b> Make sure that in your very worst case you can have 3 years of cash or bridge to profitability. A little extra dilution in a recession is better than uncertainty on multiples or cash position in the future.</li><li><b>Remember that getting profitable gives you more options than not.</b> The lower your burn, the higher your leverage all else being equal.</li><li><b>Expect more inside rounds.</b>&nbsp;Many VCs are focusing first on their own portfolio in terms of funding, and then will look externally in a few months. Expect many of the rounds in the next few months to be driven by insiders. In some cases these will be reopenings of prior rounds.</li><li><b>Pricing uncertainty.</b>&nbsp;VCs are struggling with how bad businesses will be impact due to the recession. Given that the next 3-6 months are highly uncertain VCs do not know what valuation to give. Will the business still grow its projected 300% this year or will it growth 50%? Enterprise sales deals from last year are closing in April, but will new sales deals initiated remotely last month close or stay open longer? Given the business uncertainty many VCs are having trouble giving offers, making fundraising harder.</li><li><b>May and June are likely to be months of relative optimism</b>. The stock markets are resilient. Lockups are coming off. The sun is out. Big promises are being made on vaccines and drugs (without data to support them yet). The economic carnage has not been highlighted by media much yet. The next 2 months may be a relatively good time to fundraise.</li></ul><br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_21jujPuDBg/Xp0OzWGYGjI/AAAAAAAAHJE/Pfj1z--0Kogs6x6x34BTfCcTZ9f9BybkQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-04-19%2Bat%2B7.53.34%2BPM.png\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_21jujPuDBg/Xp0OzWGYGjI/AAAAAAAAHJE/Pfj1z--0Kogs6x6x34BTfCcTZ9f9BybkQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-04-19%2Bat%2B7.53.34%2BPM.png\" width=\"640\" /></a><br /><br /><b>3. Understand which customers are at risk, and which should be embraced.</b><br />If you sell to enterprises, go through your customer list. If you have revenue concentration, look at your top N accounts. Do you have travel, local governments, retail, real estate, or other customers? If so, which are high risk of cancelation or renegotiation? You can discount this revenue as you plan for burn.&nbsp; You may need to fire bad customers, or stop extending credit.<br /><br />Which customers also seem to be accelerating or doing better in this time? You may want to spend more time with them or focus your sales efforts on upselling your most stable customers or getting your product prepaid.<br /><br />If you do not have high revenue concentration, you can instead look at vertical views. What % of your business is exposed to travel, DTC, offline retail, restaurants or other segments? This will allow you to predict customer churn or models and understand runway. You may also want to cut marketing or inside sales to verticals that are likely to churn and reallocate spend to verticals that will be stable or grow.<br /><br /><b>4. Plan for hiring freezes or layoffs.</b><br />Although it takes time to build a recruiting pipeline, when in doubt you may want to freeze hiring and wait to see the impact the recession will have on your business. If you think there is some chance you will need to do a layoff, plan it in advance. It often takes some time to execute and you want to do it well, both for the people leaving as well as the employees who stay behind.<br /><br />The key tenets of a layoff include:<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Have a crisp plan and process.</li><li>Treat people well.</li><li>Create stability for the people who are still with the company. This layoff's goal is to save their jobs and save the company, not remove other people's jobs.</li><li>Cut deeper than you ever think you will need to. It is much worse to do multiple sequential layoffs than a single deep cut. You can always rehire people if you cut too much, but it is tough and hurts the culture to do multiple rounds.</li></ul><br />When I moved out to Silicon Valley I joined a high flying startup backed by Sequoia and Matrix. The company grew from 120 to 150 people, and then shrank to ~12 people over 5 rounds of lay offs as the internet bubble imploded. I got laid off in the 3rd round. It would have been better for the company to do one big cut up front and preserve cash than to wait through multiple layoffs and keep burning large sums of money. Repeated layoffs devastated moral at the company.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/03/31/planning-and-managing-layoffs/\">A16Z has a good guide to planning layoffs here.</a><br /><br /><b>5. Build culture and create stability for employees</b><br />While many founders thrive on unpredictability, most employees crave stability. Particularly in times like these it is important for people to feel safe and secure. Employee stability may include create and communicating the following:<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Financial stability of the company. </b>Explain cash position, customers, and how the company is going to bridge the COVID-19 recession.</li><li><b>COVID plans and policies.</b> People have uncertainty about whether they can go back into the office and under what conditions to do so. You can put together a plan around office reopening. Some companies have told employees that they will have the *option* to work from home through e.g. September, so employees can plan out a few months of their life in advance. Each state has its own requirements for businesses to reopen so this can get complicated if you are a larger company or deal with manufacturing.</li><li><b>Build ties. </b>Bonds help in times of adversity. Can you do a zoom-based speaker series? Drinks for the team? Think of ways to get people together or bonding in small groups.</li></ul><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Offensive moves</span></b><br />There is an old saying to \"never waste a good recession\". While recessions can be daunting, scary times it may also create opportunities for your business.<br /><br /><b>1. Reposition your company and grow faster.</b> A number of companies are actually doing better due to COVID. If you are working on online collaboration, edtech, or certain vertical SaaS, you may be doing better than ever. You may also want to reposition your company's marketing materials and narrative towards cost-cutting, remote collaboration, outsourcing, or other topical areas.<br /><br />Zoom, Instacart, and others probably gained multiple years of customer adoption and enterprise growth due to this new environment.<br /><br /><b>2. Hire great people. </b>Great people are coming onto the market due to layoffs, company shut downs (should see more of those in 6-12 months) and just general feelings of instability. If you are a stable, growing company now is a great time to target specific amazing people to hire.<br /><br /><b>3. M&amp;A time!</b> In the next year or two there will be a lot of opportunities to either buy other companies and grow into new areas, or to exit. Some companies that are seeing fast, non-sustainable growth due to work-from-home and social distancing may want to exit while things look good (looking at you much of EdTech!).<br /><br /><b>4. Build your moat, build your infrastructure. </b>The next few months may be a good time to focus on the moats you can build around your business. Your competitors may be distracted by internal issues, and new startups are less likely to get funded or thrive. How can you use this to your advantage?<br /><br /><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What does the future bring?</span></b><br />COVID-19 has caused a massive shift in the way people work and live. This creates new opportunities for startups. In general, there are a few ways to segment startups.<br /><br /><b>a. Growth due to COVID versus Sustainability of growth.</b><br />A number of companies have already shown clear outcomes from COVID. For example, Zoom and Instacart will grow rapidly due to COVID and likely reset at a new baseline after the crisis. Other companies will be clearly hurt by the crisis, but this should be temporary. For example, TripActions will undoubtedly snap back once enterprises have people travel again.<br /><br />The hard part is to tell which companies (a) may or may not sustain their changes in either positive or negative directions (for example, which EdTech co's will snap to a higher baseline and which will not) and (b) which companies that are \"doing OK\" right now will have their business shrink rapidly once large enterprises have had enough time to react (the next 3-6 months).<br /><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hHc3mgT4CCQ/Xp0PDF6UuZI/AAAAAAAAHJM/-V19AQoqfmM_Lr3tCwJafDjalWBJ9PxCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-04-19%2Bat%2B7.54.47%2BPM.png\" style=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hHc3mgT4CCQ/Xp0PDF6UuZI/AAAAAAAAHJM/-V19AQoqfmM_Lr3tCwJafDjalWBJ9PxCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-04-19%2Bat%2B7.54.47%2BPM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a><br /><b>b. Capital intensive business versus not.</b><br />Capital markets are uncertain right now. Many late stage investors are waiting for the other shoe to drop. For example, big hedge funds with big public market positions (and small private market positions), are spending almost all their time looking for public market mispricing or deals. They are sitting out aspects of late stage private investing right now. The same holds true for some family offices. Traditional late stage VCs are focusing on their own portfolios or cherry picking a handful of startups with the most interest.<br /><br />The more capital intensive the business, the rougher the next year or so will be. Now is a good time to revisit unit economics, renegotiate with a core supplier, or otherwise determine how to have capital to bridge the next 2-3 years.</div>~\n",

Given the lack of robust testing in much of the world, case loads are probably dramatically understated. A simple rule of thumb is that if you assume a 1% mortality rate, and 3 weeks for the first people to die, 5 deaths today from COVID means ~500 cases 3 weeks ago. If the case count doubles every week, that means 8*500=4000 cases today. Notably, Washington State has 29 deaths. Assuming we are overcounting cases due to clustering by 2X, we still end up with &gt;10,000 people in Washington state infected, versus the official 290.

Trinet for full-time remote/distributed workers.</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">With the move to more and more remote workers and teams a number of companies are struggling with basic payroll and benefits for non-US employees. This is particularly true if the company is a startup or has many small teams around the world. There is a lot of complexity in terms of whether someone is an independent contractor or not, setting up foreign subsidiaries and payments, working with a PEO etc. The product would be a modern, easy to use way to hire and pay remote full time (and part-time) teams. You can think of it as \"Trinet v2\". Some of the complexity in the product may be driven by the need to establish foreign entities to hire remote workers.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.letsdeel.com/\">Deel</a>&nbsp;is doing a subset for contractors, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://runahr.com/\">RunaHR</a>&nbsp;is doing payroll in LATAM.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">2. New social network.</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">TikTok is a good reminder for the generational turnover of social products. While most social networks have not proven to be durable over time (Friendster, MySpace, Orkut, ....) the ones that take over generational shifts or new content types and formats have become massive companies. In general, most of the value of a social product is the network and interactions of the people using the product, with the remainder of the value coming from the product software scaffolding itself.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Places to watch for a new social products may include:</span><br /><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Generational shifts.</b>&nbsp;Every 5-7 years there is room for a new social network to emerge in the next wave of high school and college students. TikTok is a good example of this, following SnapChat in the past.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>New content and formats.</b>&nbsp;The rise of podcasting and transcription, short form content highlighting, or other approaches may yield the right engagement model for a new social product to emerge. Past versions of this include Instagram for mobile photos and Pinterest for pins.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Gaming communities.&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/\">Discord</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2019/06/04/is-fortnite-the-new-social-media-home-for-teens/#14c137b059f9\">Fortnite</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/\">Minecraft</a>&nbsp;and others have shown the appetite for social networks in the context of gaming. It is always possible a game or gaming-centric network will make the jump to a broadbased one, assuming its features evolve over time to subsume additional use cases.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Verticals.</b>&nbsp;There is likely room for additional vertical social networks for very large verticals. Neighborhoods in particular still feel like a large potential opportunity over time with the sets of layered information and commerce that can be attached.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nextdoor.com/\">Nextdoor</a>&nbsp;feels a bit like the Myspace of its vertical in that someone could challenge it - however no Facebook of neighborhoods has arisen to challenge it.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>High user fatigue.</b>&nbsp;In parallel, user fatigue around spam, bots, and outrage culture without any controls built to deal with this may create the opening for a new network. What would be a network which allowed for more thoughtful discourse? Or at least the ability to more actively mute topics, threads, and groups of users while surfacing better content algorithmically?</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>VR.</b>&nbsp;This is not near term, but a Black Sun like network could emerge eventually with a rise in VR.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Past examples relevant for today?</b>&nbsp;Things like IRC,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL\">the WELL</a>, and others captured user behavior in unique ways. One aspect was the highly curated or self organized nature of these communities prior to the Internet being deluged by everyone. There is room for a throwback to these more concentrated, in some sense high end intellectual (and non intellectual) communities.</span></li></ul><div><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Of the networks that has the cleanest stand alone use case and potential to be worth $100B, the ones which may be displaced or competed with soonest may include (1)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;which captures both high velocity news, public discourse, and CRM in a single communication and media network. Twitter has not evolved much as a product with basics still missing a decade plus later. (2) LinkedIn. Github should have been a strong competitor to LinkedIn for engineers and designers. There may be ways to try to take over other specific use cases from the company as a starting point.</span></div><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">3. More SaaS and Dev Tools.</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">This one is kind of obvious, and I suggest analysis to be done below to find opportunities in this area (see \"Software areas for exploration). I have specific ideas I may try to help pull together or test in 2020.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">4. ADT 2.0: Digital neighborhood watch.</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">The common approach to security cameras is to sell the camera as a DIY installation hardware sales and then charge an attach to cloud storage. However, the traditional path to home security includes&nbsp;<i>services-centric</i>&nbsp;companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adt.com/\">ADT</a>. ADT will install the hardware for you, have a person in the middle in case needed for monitoring, and spins off cash like crazy due to its subscription model.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">I would love to see a modern next-generation consumer-centric ADT-like model. This model would include:</span><br /><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Services model. Part of the purchase includes a technician showing up and doing the installation. There would be no DIY component.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Subscription only. The product would be a hardware/software/services bundle with an up front fee and ongoing subscription as default.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Network driven. All cameras in a neighborhood would be virtually networked - for example, as a user I could report that someone stole packages from my doorstep and an alert would go out to all my neighbors to their phones to bring their own packages inside. There are interesting network effects available here as well as the potential for a neighborhood social product to be built on top.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Data exhaust. If you have enough camera density by neighborhood, other things suddenly become interesting adjacent businesses. For example, could you add a pollution sensor to installs and get unique and valuable data? Weather data? There are lots of opportunities here outside of home security once you have an installed base.</span></li></ul><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">I have long wanted to fund or incubate a company in this area. Nest and Ring are trying to do things on the consumer side, but not quite there yet.

Neighborhood (and corporate?) pollution sensor networks.</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Relatedly, the California wildfires have caused me as a parent to look frequently at pollution data. Even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patrickcollison.com/pollution\">basal pollution levels</a>&nbsp;may impact cognitive function. There seems to be room for both home/neighborhood and corporate level pollution sensor networks. One could imagine a service where companies or people buy hardware + analytics for their homes or facilities and then a subscription for people who do not own the hardware but live nearby. An early player in this area is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aclima.io/\">Aclima</a>&nbsp;which has done&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aclima.io/press/aclima-google-scale-air-quality-mapping-to-more-places-around-the-world/\">cool things with Google</a>.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">6.

The idea was to help people buy carbon offsets for their own activities. At the time, we saw very little interest.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">As an additional aside, Nuclear is a strong potential solution for climate change but is politically unpopular.

Software-only defense contractor.</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/\">Anduril</a>&nbsp;is a next-generation defense contractor focused on hardware + software (including machine learning) bundles. There is probably room for an adjacent company focused solely on software-centric machine learning and intelligence applications. Unlike Palantir, which seems to have a services-centric model, this new company would be focused on a more SaaS-centric software-driven model. The rise of machine learning and machine vision as analytical tools opens up the door for a new contractor to emerge to challenge incumbents, and also to provide new applications not available in the pre-ML world.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><u><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">B.

Global 2000 company IT needs.</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Silicon Valley enterprise startups often focus on the needs of other mid-stage tech companies as customers, rather than the large enterprises that make up much of the business world by revenue. There are probably a dozen $10B+ enterprise software companies to build that are unique to the largest companies of the world that most Silicon Valley founders are never exposed to (UIPath is a good example of a company serving such a need).</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">I would love to see the following analysis:</span><br /><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>A map of repetitious tasks, spreadsheets, and manual data extraction by function&nbsp;</b>in the Fortune 500.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><b>Budget breakdown of current software spend</b>, by function, by line, in the Fortune 500.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">A view of&nbsp;<b>what Accenture, CapGemini, and Deloitte keep building&nbsp;</b>over and over for large enterprises.

In a few years, aspects of RPA and NoCode are likely to be incorporated into an increasing proportion of enterprise applications as a standard tool set. While the early leading apps of this area (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uipath.com/\">UIPath</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">Airtable</a>, ...) make great headways, additional players like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://parabola.io/\">Parabola</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://retool.com/\">Retool</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simpo.com/\">Simpo</a>&nbsp;continue to take on additional uses cases.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738627\">implications to society</a>&nbsp;if someone were to translate this to humans is dramatic. Imagine if any person, of any age, could have a child. Women could decide to push back child bearing dramatically without freezing eggs in advance. Gay couples could have kids together with genes from both sides. There are also nefarious uses - for example if you surreptitiously scrape skin off Kanye's hands in a club you might be able to show up 9 months later with a baby and paternity suit. Ovid Research is working on one aspect of this.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Relatedly, for endangered species, a non-commercial effort should be made to freeze cells from every living animal (assuming non-disruptive) and also to create embryonic stem cell or germline lines for future use in potential species rescue or rebirth. Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29973581\">white rhino example</a>&nbsp;of potential proof of concept approaches.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">11. Longevity basics</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Right now the bar for longevity or anti-aging companies is a high one (cure aging!). While each company starts with a specific targeted indication, I sometimes wonder if people are being too bold in application versus ambition. It would be great to want to cure aging, but start really small. The bar for anti-aging may be too high and too science-centric. Are there simple approaches to help people rapidly with off the shelf or repositioned drugs?</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">I think companies could set a lower bar and start by restoring function that dramatically improves lots of people's quality of life. Examples would include eyesight and hearing. For example, many people start to get blurry vision in their 40s, due to a variety of factors including the mix of proteins in the lens of the eye causing hardening and potentially the muscle holding the lens aging. Could a simple approach like rapamycin droplets in the eye reverse aspects of aging and therefore eyesight? Similarly, are there treatments that could restore lost hair in men or have other cosmetic applications?</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">As an aside, if you want to join an anti-aging company,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bioagelabs.com/\">BioAge</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.springdiscovery.com/\">Spring Discovery</a>&nbsp;are the two to watch IMO (I am involved with both, as well as a number of other companies mentioned in this post).</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><u><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">D. Biotech Areas For Exploration:</span></u></b><br /><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">12. Biomarkers for everything (wetware and/or AI and digital)</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Being able to measure a physiological change or response allows you to both understand a disease and its progression, as well as to create drugs to treat the disease. Major conditions such as Alzheimer's disease&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0348-z\">have traditionally been limited</a>&nbsp;in drug creation due to an inability to find biomarkers that correspond with disease progression. This means that historically Alzheimer's trials have only been able to recruit people with late stages of the disease for trials. It would be useful to do deep proteomic, metabolomic, and potentially methalomic analysis of people with different diseases to start to develop robust biomarkers for all major diseases.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are also \"electronic\" biomarkers that should be developed and put into use. For example, by using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/health/breast-cancer-mammogram-artificial-intelligence.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">machine learning on pictures</a>&nbsp;or short videos of children can you tell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2019/05/researchers-using-machine-learning-screen-autism-children/\">where they might be on the autism spectrum</a>? Or can you tell if someone is developing Alzheimer's or other disorders based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.net/9-2-14-alzheimers-gait/\">changes in gait</a>&nbsp;and phone sensors? There is a wealth of digital data we are not using for diagnosis and treatment. The challenge is taking a one-off research study and translating it into an actual product in widespread use.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Exact Sciences is a good example of a colon cancer biomarker that has decreased the needs for colonoscopies while creating a $10 billion+ company. Unfortunately, like everything in healthcare, the road from a great biomarker to commercial success may be long and difficult.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_Sciences_(company)\">Exact Sciences</a>&nbsp;was founded in 1995, when public in 2001, and had a flat market cap for about a decade before in-licensing and developing its colon cancer screen in 2009-2014. A better product alone in healthcare does not mean success or adoption without the right industry body approvals and insurance reimbursement. However, from a human impact perspective this field holds enormous potential.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br /></span><b><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">NOTES</span></b><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">[1] For nuclear - an update on the decades old technology used in current reactors (for example molten core reactors or SMRs) + a PR campaign targeting millennials and GenZ seems valuable to do. Maybe you rebrand the newer safer technology something completely unrelated to nuclear? \"Green atomics\" or the like? When I last looked at nuclear 5-6 years ago, a big cost to build and deploy was largely NIMBYism driven - cost delays due to protests led to uncertain completion timelines, delays, and financing costs.

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In order to sell to enterprises, SaaS startups usually need to add the same 5 core product features. These features allow for a dramatic increase in price (often a few fold) and the ability to close large accounts that may scale in the millions of dollars <i>per customer</i>.<br /><br />The below assumes you have something that is working bottoms up that you want to adapt for enterprise. If your core product does not have product/market fit, adding the below features won't help much.<br /><br />Enterprise features usually include:<br /><br /><b>1. Single Sign On (SSO).</b><br />In some cases, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on\">SSO</a> is sufficient to cause enterprises to adopt your product. This is often the minimal enterprise feature set.<br /><br /><b>2. Admin View &amp; Permissions.</b><br />Often you want to be able to have an admin set permissions for individuals or groups of users. Alternatively, you want to be able to set preferences at the group level versus individual level (for example, you do not want to add every new engineering hire to 50 slack channels. You would rather add them to \"eng\" and have it propagate to all channels. Lastly, you want to be able to have an admin take over or manage specific permissions. This is often the second or thing most requested feature for enterprises.<br /><br /><b>3. Security &amp; Compliance.</b><br />The most common compliance request is<a href=\"https://vanta.com/aboutvanta\"> SOC2</a>, which sets the data and information security policies, procedures and approaches. Other forms of compliance may include GDPR, HIPAA (for healthcare companies) and FEDRamp (for US Government contractors). In general, these security compliance guidelines set policies around things like data encryption, rules for which employees have access to what data, and even things like physical security of servers on which data is stored.<br /><br />Enterprises may additionally request a separate security audit or review, or may want their security team to come visit and ask questions first hand.<br /><br /><b>4. Invoicing.</b><br />Your bottom up pricing often allows an early adopter to put your product on a credit card. For large enterprises there are specific types of invoices / integrations you may need to do over time. This is usually not a deal breaker, but makes it easier to get paid.<br /><br /><b>5. Paperwork.</b><br />Additionally, you may need to do a lot of paperwork and procurement reviews with large enterprises. This may necessitate a sales operations or support team. Not a product feature, but good to know about.  <br /><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><div dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Enterprise sales:<br /><br />Bigco: We want to buy your thing.<br />Me: Great!

The world largely continues to move to the cloud, but sometimes this is necessary for at least a subset of customers. Some SaaS companies chose to skip customers who require an on-premise solution, while for others the business case / revenue is sufficient to justify it.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Generally the 5 features listed above are straight forward to do and take at most a few engineers for a few months each (and may be banged out by a small team over 3-9 months depending on how many are needed, and the complexity of e.g. admin view).

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Startups are hard. There are a few moments in every startups life that feel magical and make the grind (at least temporarily) worth it. Magic startup moments include:<br /><div><br /></div><div><b>Your first customer payment.</b></div><div>It is not a coincidence that so many restaurants have their first $10 bill framed and hung on a wall. Finding someone who wants your product enough to pay for it, and making money from something you built with your own two hands feels good.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Your first magic executive.</b></div><div>As a startup matures, its leadership bench gets built out. Many first-time founders of managers tend to fight delegating to others. Or they promote \"smart, junior athletes\" to run a function like engineering or sales and watch them flounder (often while thinking the floundering is normal execution). Then, that magic moment happens - you hire a tried and true, excellent executive for a part of the company. Suddenly, great people get hired, the right initiatives are launched, and that area of the company starts to function incredibly well. This is often the moment when founders learn to delegate, and think \"I want more people like her\".</div><div><br /></div><div><b>That special customer thank you.</b></div><div><div>Many companies change the lives of their customers for the better without realizing it. For mission-centric companies (for example a genomics company) deep, from-the-heart thank you notes from customers may arrive quite early. For other types of companies a thoughtful email or letter will suddenly show up thanking you for helping your customer and for making their lives better. These letters give you an incentive to keep going.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>The sale.</b></div><div>The ends of things are often bittersweet. Successfully selling your company and feeling that you finally made it, that your employees have a stable place to work, that you made money for yourself, your family, and your investors, and that you can relax just a little bit, can be a truly magic moment.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>The reunion.</b></div><div>Sometimes an employee will reach out to you years after they left your company to thank you for the formative experience they had working for you. Or, a bunch of \"old timers\" from the company's early days get together to swap stories and discuss what was and the crazy things your company did to ship that product, keep the lights on, or land that partnership.</div><div><br /><br /></div></div><div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><b style=\"background-color: white;

Big customers are growing faster for Zoom versus customers overall. I know Slack started on enterprise sales late, so it is possible this number could have been even larger today.<br /><br />Many technical or product-centric founders have an innate (and inappropriate) fear of sales[0]. While it is inevitable that their company will need to adopt direct sales, technical founders often procrastinate on building a sales force. This is usually a mistake. If direct sales could boost growth from 15% a month to 20% a quarter on $1M in ARR, the company will have $184M in revenue versus $93M in revenue after 4 years[1].<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lt-tCMTtsLI/XY-CHVSYR8I/AAAAAAAAGr8/eEZx4-TT0j8WZ66SDyIfdY-23rQdW_LIQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/revenue.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lt-tCMTtsLI/XY-CHVSYR8I/AAAAAAAAGr8/eEZx4-TT0j8WZ66SDyIfdY-23rQdW_LIQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/revenue.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div>If the company actually does not have good bottoms-up adoption, the impact sales can be even more striking.

Familiarity.</b><br />Most technical founders have strong familiarity with bottoms-up sales. They download open source packages all the time, and adopted Github or PagerDuty or Stripe through word of mouth. What many founders have not seen directly is how well a repeatable sales engine can work.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/05/26/hiring-sales-why-what/\">The simplest advice to founders on this point is \"just do it\"</a>. Just as you needed to learn how to do PR,&nbsp; how to hire and negotiate salaries, how to raise money, or how to hire other specific functions (finance, legal, customer support etc, you will need to learn how to do hire sales people and add go-to-market as a function.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://growth.eladgil.com/book/chapter-4-building-the-executive-team/hiring-executives/\">To learn how to hire a sales leader,</a> you need to take the same steps you took to learn how to hire marketing or customer support or legal - ask others who are 2-3 years ahead you as founders who have done something similar how they did it. Or go and find 3-5 great sales leaders or CROs and ask them how to hire, and interview for the role, and how to best run the function.<br /><br />Just as you do not need to run your finance team yourself, you can hire a great sales leader to partner with to drive sales for you.<br /><br /><b>2. Perception of sales as an art versus science. In reality there is a sales playbook.</b><br />Since sales are stereotypically driven by people with liberal arts degrees who played <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sportsball\">sportsball</a> in college, technical founders often view it as a bit of dark magic involving expensive dinners, cross country flights, and a lot of small talk, high-fiving, and gong-hitting.<br /><br />In reality, sales is a giant process engineering exercise which has benefited from 40 years of iteration. A great sales leader will have an effective playbook they can apply, a pipeline process to run, and a hiring and compensation approach that will work for your market.<br /><br />Sales at its best is a repeatable, understandable operational process that can be run in a metric driven way. Indeed, sales productivity is dramatically easier to track and understand versus engineering productivity. Metrics may include revenue productivity per head, payback periods, and funnel or pilot conversion and close.<br /><br />The temptation of a technical founder is to make sales up as they go along. For your sake, it is best to resist this temptation to re-invent the wheel and to hire someone who knows what they are doing. You will obviously need to work with this individual to set overall objectives, interview the first hires for culture and the like. But you should view sales as an integral part of your startup team - and not something to design yourself from scratch.<br /><b><br /></b><b>3. Cool factor.</b><br />Bottoms-up adoption is considered much cooler and more organic than doing inside or direct sales. Your customers are coming to you. How cool is that? Why would you ever lower yourself by going to them and actively engaging them?<br /><br />The even cooler thing is to build a monster company having enormous impact and a platform you can use to influence the lives of millions and generate the revenue and market cap to affect humanity-level productivity and social change.<br /><br />If resistance comes from your team versus you, explain to them that your goal as a company is to build something great. To build something at scale, you will need to get big companies to adopt your product (even more people can use it!), that all the companies your employees use and admire actually have sales forces, and that sales at its best can provide insights that would be more challenging to get otherwise (see below)<br /><br /><b>4. Cultural concerns.</b><br /><div>\"Sales will be an invasion of fratty liberal arts people and our culture will be ruined! There will be people with nicely pressed shirts making small talk in loud voices while making too much direct eye contact! Don't they realize life is not a staring contest?!?!!!\"[2]<br /><br />Often when I hear about the cultural concerns of working with sales, it is from people who have never worked with sales. The reality is:<br />a. You will ramp sales headcount slowly at first. Unless you have built a sales org before, it is wise to start small. Add a sales leader. See how it goes. Have her add 1-2 people. See how it goes.<br />b. Sales tends to be geographically distributed. Direct sales people often work in region since much of their time is on the road. Inside sales teams (who are often phone and email based sales) may be more cost efficient to have in a remote office. The reality is you will eventually be going out of your way to get the sales people together in one spot for offsites and conferences, or to spend time at HQ, versus them taking over your home office. The primary place I have seen sales actually dominate a culture is when you have a remote sales office and then add a handful of engineers and leave the engineers to fend for themselves. Or when you have a sales-centric CEO to begin with, in which case the culture will be sales-centric as expected.<br /><br />Sales will change your culture, but it is an inevitable change. Instead of fighting it determine how you can productively incorporate sales people. How can you grow in a sustainable manner? How do you want your culture to evolve? Taking it slow is a better long term solution than not doing it at all (or waiting to long and regretting it).<br /><br /><b>5. Sales at its best.</b></div><div>At its best, sales is not only a large revenue driver, but also a way to get customer feedback and input back to the team. It should drive rapid revenue growth while feeding your team competitive intelligence, customer concerns, feature requests, and other insights from the field. These can help drive business strategy, product roadmaps, and your ultimate success as a company.<br /><br /><b>6. Sales can cause a company to overspend and crash &amp; burn.</b><br />I have seen instances where a company overhires a sales force before it has a repeatable working sales model, or real product-market fit. In this case, a sales team can be existentially bad for a company. You will burn through all your cash before sales shows success. Often this happens when an incoming sales leader over promises and over hires, and sales productivity is slower than expected. For example, a company may hire 20 sales reps and promise a 6 months payback period, when in reality the new sales reps ramp slower and are less productive. Suddenly, the company is stuck paying out a sales guarantee to new hires and it blows up due to poor cash management. This pattern is actually quite common. It is often better to start sales teams small and experimental, and then ramp.<br /><br />Give yourself permission to ramp sales slowly, make sure things are working, and then ramp some more.</div><div><br /><b>Fundamental Decision</b><br />The fundamental decision a technical or product-centric founder faces is this:<br />Do you want your product to be adopted by as many people as possible, including people working at the largest companies in the world? Do you want to win your market and industry?<br /><br />If your answer is yes and you are running a SaaS or enterprise company, you should start to build a sales force as soon as you have signs of product market fit[3]. Don't wait. Don't procrastinate. Don't make excuses. Even if bottoms-up is working, you will end up with a smaller, less important company if you wait on building real sales and customer success teams.<br /><br />You should feel free to start small and take incremental steps - but the key is to take the steps early. Don't wait too long. You may also go through 1-2 sales leaders before finding the right one (and understanding what to look for for your product and culture)[4]. That is OK too. Give yourself permission to make a mistake or two, and let your team know this is all an experiment. This is all about the long term.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/she_travels\">Stephanie (Schatz) Friedman</a> for early comments on this post.<br /><br /></div><div><b>NOTES</b></div><div>[0] A quick aside on sales definitions:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u4bgOqcGavY/XZOn-zRrt_I/AAAAAAAAGs0/bv1Lmjhdtngu0hc9KdolcUTzkyvtgsh1wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-01%2Bat%2B12.24.15%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u4bgOqcGavY/XZOn-zRrt_I/AAAAAAAAGs0/bv1Lmjhdtngu0hc9KdolcUTzkyvtgsh1wCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-10-01%2Bat%2B12.24.15%2BPM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><br />[1] You of course want good unit economics and payback times on any customer acquisition efforts, including direct sales.<br /><br />[2] I am of course joking. I have a technical Ph.D. and a math degree so actually kind of hate most small talk.<br /><br />[3] Assuming your price point and return on a customer is high enough. For example, if you are only making $100 per year per customer, you can not afford a sales force. At tens of thousands per customer, you can afford an inside sales force. At $100K+ per customer, you can afford direct field sales.<br /><br />[4] By the way, if your gut is telling you the new sales leader or AE is doing a bad job, they probably are. I have often seen technical or product-centric founders second guess their own judgement on people in these roles. Excellence has the same feel irrespective of function.</div></div>~\n",
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Industry towns[1] emerge due to the critical mass of having employees, entrepreneurs, suppliers, business partners, potential customers, and investors in the same geographic location. Some industry towns are driven by their geography - for example manufacturing sites on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border, Houston for oil &amp; gas, or wineries in Napa (where the right conditions exist for grapes to grow). Other industry towns emerge due to early founding effects - for example <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/02/why-are-all-the-big-american-car-companies-based-in-michigan.html\">Detroit largely emerged as an automotive center as Henry Ford and Ransom Olds </a>happened to live there when they set up shop (Ford Motor Company and Oldsmobile)[2]. Other companies and suppliers moved to be close to Ford and Oldsmobile and an industry town was born.<br /><br />If you were going into the movie business, you would be encouraged to move to Hollywood, Lagos, or Mumbai. If you wanted to go into finance, New York, London, and Hong Kong would be amongst the primary places to move. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1998/11/clusters-and-the-new-economics-of-competition\">Industry towns exist for most major industries</a>, including energy, finance, movies and entertainment and other areas.<br /><br />Oddly, it is now controversial to say industry towns also hold true for tech - if you want to start a company that will be worth $10 billion or more, the best places to start it are Silicon Valley[6] (for the US), Beijing (China), and Bengaluru (India). There are also regional centers of excellence (Jakarta for Indonesia, Singapore, Sao Paolo for Brazil, etc.) and then secondary centers in the main markets (London, Stockholm, Paris, Berlin in Europe amongst others. Shenzen and Shanghai in China. New York, and to a lesser extent Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, San Diego, Atlanta, DC and others in the US). This does not mean it is impossible to succeed elsewhere. Rather, startups (and careers) are hard enough as it is, so loading the deck in your favor matters.<br /><br />On average, being in an industry town is more likely to lead to success than being elsewhere. There will, of course, be successes everywhere. However, market capitalization, revenue, key partnerships, and outsized talent tend to aggregate in industry towns.<br /><br />Industry towns self-perpetuate as you have a critical mass of talent, suppliers, customers, investors, and know-how in a single geographic area. A cluster, once it exists is self perpetuating and attracts more of the same.<br /><br /><b>Why Move To An Industry Town?</b><br />If you want to go into the movie business and someone told you to go to San Francisco instead of Hollywood, you would think they are nuts. It does not mean that you could not have a movie career in San Francisco - but it would be more challenging[3].&nbsp; Movies are written by authors who <i>could</i> live anywhere, are filmed onsite around the world, and <i>could</i> be digitally edited from anywhere. Actors <i>could</i> fly to any site in the world to act. But for the Western markets most of the critical mass of the industry still happens in Hollywood.<br /><br />Technology startups have their own industry towns in places like Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Bengaluru. Secondary towns include London, New York, Shenzen, and Shanghai. On average, going elsewhere will make it harder to succeed in a career in technology.<br /><br />Similarly, while you <i>can</i> build a technology company from anywhere, there is a real advantage to being in an industry town.<br /><br />Using the <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies\">data from CBS Insights on current unicorns</a>, one can quickly see patterns in terms of where <b><i>private</i></b> startup market cap is concentrated.

Almost half of New York's market cap is from WeWork, which is more real estate company than technology company - and another $10B or so is from DTC companies (indeed, NY is an industry town for next-gen DTC companies).<br /><br />Nonetheless, the pattern holds - in every market one city takes most of the market cap. For example, London is 66% of the private unicorn market cap in the UK, Silicon Valley is 57% of US market cap, and Berlin is about half of Germany's.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WXVrZA5ZjA/XQjfzrVVStI/AAAAAAAAGbg/OfU8syY5CIE4umHqjzCR6-N4SLViYZIfQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-06-18%2Bat%2B5.57.26%2BAM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WXVrZA5ZjA/XQjfzrVVStI/AAAAAAAAGbg/OfU8syY5CIE4umHqjzCR6-N4SLViYZIfQCLcBGAs/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-06-18%2Bat%2B5.57.26%2BAM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />If you add back the recent IPOs (Uber, Lyft, Pinterest, Zoom) to Silicon Valley, it becomes 65% of total US unicorn market cap.<br /><br />Here is similar date by overall number of unicorns (versus percentage of market cap):<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kk1I6o0Yxs/XQrR-xMkNbI/AAAAAAAAGcU/HeW-nkMglygYeP3uxxfyeD2bxHBewScVACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-06-19%2Bat%2B5.22.16%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kk1I6o0Yxs/XQrR-xMkNbI/AAAAAAAAGcU/HeW-nkMglygYeP3uxxfyeD2bxHBewScVACLcBGAs/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-06-19%2Bat%2B5.22.16%2BPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>India is unique in having two cities of roughly equal unicorn market cap with 6 unicorns in Bengaluru and 8 in New Delhi together making up 78% of Indian unicorn market cap.<br /><br /><b>So why are industry towns so powerful?</b><br /><br /><b>1. Talent base.</b>&nbsp;Great engineers, sales people, product people, etc. exist all over the world. However, the highest concentration of outstanding ones are concentrated in industry towns (just as the highest concentration of great actors in the USA live in Los Angeles). Similarly, the people who know how to scale technology companies are concentrated in the tech epicenters in the graphs above. Many companies come to the SF Bay Area to fundraise post product-market fit to access this talent base and know-how.<br /><br /><b>2. Early customers.</b>&nbsp;For some industries your customers are mainly elsewhere. For example, if you are selling optimization software for oil well extraction, you do not have many customers in Silicon Valley. However, if you are selling generally useful enterprise software or Saas, many early adopters for your product exist in the Bay Area. Technology companies are more likely to early adopt new products than older companies for many categories of enterprise software. Similarly, many early consumer product influencers for technology products are based in the Bay Area[5]. Often, the best place to find early adopters of technology products are in a technology cluster.<br /><br /><b>3. Unique insights and know-how.</b>&nbsp;What new paid and unpaid channels exist for your business? What are new coding or design trends? Which VCs are funding the NoCode/Devsumer or RPA market? What are the current terms for an M&amp;A offer for a 5-person machine learning team? Industry towns tend to be where early adopters spread insights that an aggressive startup can take advantage of. While some online groups can create similar activity, running into people and serendipity in information spread, board meetings, angel/founder or founder/founder conversations cannot be over appreciated.<br /><br /><b>4. Smart investors.</b> The best startups in NY, LA, DC, Boston, eventually come to Silicon Valley to fundraise. This is due to a concentration of knowledge, insight, and ambition, as well as dense networks for customers and talent bridged by the investor. Similarly, the best investors in India cluster in Bengaluru and in China in Beijing.<br /><br /><b>5. Service providers.</b>&nbsp;Legal know-how, banking, and real estate providers with flexible terms or unique outlooks cluster in industry towns. What terms is a specific investor willing to capitulate on? Your lawyer should know. In industry towns they often do.<br /><br /><b>6. Living and breathing a craft.</b><br />Some people are obsessed with their craft. Quentin Tarantino worked as a clerk in a video rental shop and spent his free time watching movies and learning from old masters. The best biologists go to dinner with other biologists and spend all their time talking about biology[4]. Industry towns attract people who view their work and their craft and their hobbies as one thing. Hard work, ambition, and a singular focus are more likely to meet with success than taking it easy, a laissez fair attitude and wanting to do a little bit of everything. While many of the most interesting founders in Silicon Valley are polymathic, they spend the brunt of their time early in their startup journey on their companies and discussing technology trends. Industry towns attract a lot of people self-obsessed with whatever it is they love to work on.<br /><br /><b>Internet markets are 10X bigger than before. There will be more $1 billion tech companies everywhere.</b><br /><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2019/05/markets-are-10x-bigger-than-ever.html\">Online software markets have grown at least 10X in the last 10 years</a>. It has indeed never been easier to start a billion dollar company from anywhere in the world. A company that would have had $10M or $20M in revenue can now reach $100M in revenue due to the global liquidity and reach the internet provides. This means more companies than ever will reach $1 billion in market cap, and there will be more companies distributed around the world than ever before. For example, there are 82 cities in which the 360+ unicorns dwell, and 44 of the cities have only a single company worth $1B or more in them.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XRFplyb1kw0/XQjmTzIsK2I/AAAAAAAAGb4/vu9-bpLvdcY2kIQBjLOv9ofwgbj6ZnngQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-06-18%2Bat%2B6.25.12%2BAM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XRFplyb1kw0/XQjmTzIsK2I/AAAAAAAAGb4/vu9-bpLvdcY2kIQBjLOv9ofwgbj6ZnngQCLcBGAs/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-06-18%2Bat%2B6.25.12%2BAM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />In parallel, technology market cap continues to grow most for startups in technology clusters or industry towns. While there are more $1 billion companies all over the world, there are more $10B+ companies in technology clusters. Market cap has historically aggregated to a small number of places. There is no clear \"why now\" to suggest the effects for industry towns listed above have shifted dramatically enough to displace them.<br /><br />The rise of distributed teams means that more companies are hiring outside of their HQ city more quickly. If you distribute your team, you need to invest earlier in process. You will need to do goal setting, strong internal communications, and lots of in person meet ups, earlier than most small companies would.  Distributed teams have a cost. In some cases the cost may be worth it. In many it is worth waiting until your startup has scale. As tooling becomes stronger we are likely to see even more distribution of teams over time. Over the next 5 years, HQs of the biggest new startups will largely be based in industry towns. 10 years out is always harder to predict.<br /><br />If you have an advantage in hiring in a local market, you can put your HQ in an industry town and your engineering office in the local market. For example, many Israeli startups will eventually move their HQ to Silicon Valley but keep an engineering team in Herzliya. In some cases, the primary market for talent is the industry town - for example Jakarta seems to attract many of the best or most experienced engineers in Indonesia - so it is not as easy to split the HQ from the rest of the company.<br /><br /><b>Exceptions that prove the rule</b><br />Seattle has spawned two of the most successful companies in tech. Microsoft was originally headquartered in Albuquerque and then moved to Bellevue/Seattle in 1979, and Amazon was started in Seattle in 1994, in part due to its tax rules. Notably, the founders of Microsoft Bill Gates and Paul Allen were born and raised in the Seattle area and then moved back for their startup - just as Ford and Olds created the auto cluster in their hometown of Detroit. While it is likely Seattle will create another mega company some day in the future, its startup scene today is smaller than Silicon Valley, New York, Los Angeles, and other US cities.<br /><br />Similarly, Warren Buffet is pointed to as an example of how a great finance person does not need to live in NY - since he lives in Omaha. While correct, there are significantly more successful finance people in NY (with spillover now into Connecticut) than there are in Omaha.<br /><br />I am not arguing that it is impossible to be successful outside of industry towns, but rather there are network and knowledge effects that both pull incredible talent to clusters, and help them succeed faster than they probably would elsewhere. There are always exceptions, but the data on private unicorn market cap above demonstrates the high concentration of the best startups in industry towns.<br /><br />Some people in tech have a visceral reaction to the suggestion that tech has industry clusters just like any other industry. This is largely driven by their own personal journey \"I left the Bay Area for [cityname] and I am doing great in life, therefore this overall thesis is wrong\". Or, \"I live in [x city] and it is great for my startup.\" If that is the case, more power to you and congratulations on your success! While great people can be successful anywhere, market cap, <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/03/the-extreme-geographic-inequality-of-high-tech-venture-capital/552026/\">venture capital raised</a>, and other data all suggest that industry towns (and their outsized success) are here to stay. As mentioned above, that does not preclude success elsewhere. Technology entrepreneurship is not zero sum.<br /><br /><b>San Francisco governance - will the tech cluster move elsewhere in the Bay Area?</b><br />The city of San Francisco has two potential paths ahead of it. It can create one of the best run, best funded, most progressive and diverse cities on the planet. With an ever growing tax basis, a burgeoning population, and an amazing geographic location, San Francisco should be one of the great cities of the world. Alternatively, a lack of affordable housing, growing homelessness, poor transit infrastructure, and rising open drug use and petty crime can continue to be problems.<br /><br />The last few years have seen a generational transfer of wealth from pension funds and endowments to San Francisco landlords. Endowments and pension funds back venture capitalists, who fund startups, who hire employees, who give much of their salaries to San Francisco landlords. People who own buildings in San Francisco have made enormous amounts of money while homelessness increases. San Francisco (and indeed, much of California) have building unfriendly regulations that are preventing housing supply from being built where it is direly needed.<br /><br />It was just 10 years ago in 2008/2009 that few major technology company outside of Saleforce were based in San Francisco. New startups were just moving up to the city or getting founded there. Over the last decade, those startups have grown up into Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, Twitter, Pinterest (which moved from Palo Alto), Stripe (which moved from Palo Alto), Square and others.<br /><br />From ~1994-2010, most leading Internet companies in the Bay Area were in San Jose, Mountain View, and Palo Alto. From ~2010-today the best new companies have been based in San Francisco. Ten years from now, will we be talking about all the technology startups still in San Francisco? Or will the epicenter have shifted yet again to Oakland, South San Francisco/Burlingame, or another part of the Bay Area instead?<br /><br />If San Francisco is not able to drop housing costs and the general affordability of living in the city, residents and companies will eventually go elsewhere. While others parts of the area are increasingly expensive, the city in the Bay Area that seizes the initiative on affordable housing, transit, commercial space and infrastructure could become the new tech epicenter of the world.<br /><br />My hope is San Francisco is able to correct its problems, and that technology companies and employee-residents play their civic role in supporting the city as it transitions.<br /><br /><b>NOTES</b><br />[1] Also known as \"clusters\" see for instance&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster</a>.<br />[2] Notably, the automotive industry was considered one form of \"high tech\" in its day.<br />[3] For example, Robin Williams lived in the Bay Area for big periods of his life.<br />[4] And, if single, they may also talk about their dating lives.<br />[5] There are obvious counter-examples in \"middle America\" products - like Pinterest &amp;

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Most of the times, startup don't work. At some point it may make sense to either (1) give up on your original product and to <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/08/5-reasons-to-sell-your-startup.html\">sell the company</a>, (2) shut down what you are doing and return money to investors, or (3) to pivot. You can read more on making the decision to give up in a future article. This post focuses on pivoting for small, early stage companies (e.g. 10 or fewer people).<br /><br /><b>A. The Four Types Of Pivots</b><br /><b><br /></b><b>1. Pivot inside your existing market, without clear new signal.</b><br />The most common type of pivot is to change direction in a market you are already in, but without any new information on the market or a new customer segment. This is the most common type of pivot, and the most likely to end badly. In general founders worry too much about sunk cost and the industry knowledge they have built. So when they pivot, they pivot inside their market instead of considering new areas to work in. In general, startups tend to fail due to bad product/market fit (either the product is not differentiated or needed, or the go-to-market does not work, or both).<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">\"When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins<br />When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.<br />When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.\"&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">- Andy Rachleff, founder of Benchmark Capital</blockquote>By staying the same bad market, the company may be doomed despite the pivot.<br /><br /><b>2. Reposition or edit down your product. Find behavior in existing product/market and amplify or focus on that (Instagram, Twitch).</b><br />Sometimes your overall product is not being adopted, but some component of it is seeing high use or early signal of user excitement. For example, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/instagram-used-to-be-called-brbn/373815/\">Burbn was a location check-in app</a> with photos, and the photo portion was getting all the attention so the product was edited down into Instagram.<br /><br />One could argue Instagram was not really a pivot, but really just good product editing.<br /><br />Relatedly, the Justin.tv team saw early signal in gaming that led to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitchs-pivot-2014-8\">Twitch being spun out</a>. If your product is seeing enthusiastic adoption in a single userbase or use case, it might make sense to focus all your attention on that use case.<br /><br />The hard part for most companies in this situation is whether to keep their legacy, non-performing business alive. This is done for both emotional reasons (this was your first product) as well as concerns about market interpretation or branding. There are two ways to deal with this:<br />A. Launch an entirely new or differently branded product or service (Twitch spinning out of Justin.tv).<br />B. Shut down the original product and focus entirely on the new one (Flickr, which came out of a Stewart Butterfield gaming company[1] or Instagram versus Burbn). If you are pivoting your userbase is tiny, and it will not matter if you shut down.<br /><br />The downside of keeping the original product alive is the time and attention the product and its customers demand from your team. It may also create a lack of clarity and confusion about your brand and the changes you are making. If your homepage primarily reflects your old product experience your new customers may not engage as deeply. Making a clean break can come by launching a new brand or website or revamping the old one to solely reflect your new direction.<br /><br />If your legacy business is providing sufficient cash flow to fund a new business it is probably worth keeping and launching a new brand. In other circumstances, you may want to shut it down, sell it, or spin it out. If you really want to give your new direction a shot, you will need to ignore or shut down your prior effort.<br /><br /><b>2b. Market pivot or product repositioning.</b><br />Sometimes it is less about your product, and more about tailoring your marketing and go to market to a different customer base from the one you started with. In many cases this will change the product you build, but sometimes it is as simple as changing your marketing collateral, website, and sales efforts to reflect a new or different customer segment. Are you selling to SMBs but should really sell to big enterprises? Are you selling to consumers but should really be selling to employers?<br /><br /><b>3. Launch a tool that you used while building your own company (Yammer, Slack).</b><br />Some of the most successful pivots (Slack out of Butterfield's second gaming company, or <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/06/25/before-1-2-billion-deal-yammer-was-side-project-largest-investor-george-zachary/#2f48cdff46d2\">Yammer out of the genealogy site Geni</a>) occurred when a company built an internal tool to run its business, and realized the tool would be valuable to other customers as well. Building something for others, that you need for yourself, is often a successful way to identify a real product or market need. In some of these cases the company is spun out in its own right (Yammer), in others the entire company reconfigures to support the new idea and product direction (<a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/masters-of-scale/episodes/48cd4864-171a-4381-85a9-bc58620e5341\">Slack</a>). In the case of the spin out, the parent company often maintains some equity portion with the remainder going to a new founding team in the new entity.<br /><br />In the case of reconfiguring an entire company, the hard part of this sort of pivot is to rebuild the team to be able to build the product or sell into the new market. For example, a consumer team will need to build an enterprise sales and product team from scratch. This may lead to significant employee turnover. If you need to make this transition and do lay offs, do it quickly and be as fair as possible to your employees who supported you in the past.<br /><br /><b>4. Do something truly new (Twitter, GOAT).</b><br />The last form of pivot is the most extreme. In this case you put aside the original product entirely, and start to iterate on new ideas on what to build.<br /><br />If you are doing a true bottoms-up restart, it is worth seriously considering shutting down the existing company and returning whatever is left of the money raised. Or, selling the company for a small return and starting something again later from scratch. More on this below.<br /><br /><b>B. When To Shut Down And Restart Versus Pivot</b><br />If you are considering doing an entirely new idea from scratch you may also want to restart your company. You should check alignment with your major investors, your co-founders, and your employee on who is on board for this change of direction. In some cases, your cofounders and board (or investors) will be fully supportive and you can get going on the new set of ideas. You may lose employees who no longer believe along the way, but that may be a good thing - you need a core set of true believers to weather the storm. <a href=\"https://upfront.com/thoughts/goat-in-defense-of-the-pivot\">The Grubwithus - &gt; GOAT transition</a> is a good example of a grounds up pivot with the investors and founders all aligned and along for the ride.<br /><br />In contrast, there may be other times where it makes sense to shut down the company and restart. For example, if the co-founders of the company need to change. Or alternatively, investors no longer want to support the team and its new vision. In this case, it is better to restart the company than to fight how to allocate new equity or with investors who no longer believe.<br /><br />Often in the case of a restart:<br /><b>a. The company returns whatever cash is left</b> to its existing investors and shuts down the original company.<br /><b>b. A new founding team is formed. </b>Sometimes this is the same founders as before, other times it may be a new configuration with equity given to the most important parts of the team. Employees may convert to founders, stay as employees, or decide to leave.<br /><b>c. The original investors are often offered a major portion of the new company's financing </b>round as a thank you for their original support.<br /><b>d. The new company goes after its new mission and market.</b><br /><br />The podcasting company Odeo went through this process. Ev Williams famously bought out the original investors of the company as Odeo was being shut down. One of Odeo's employees, Jack Dorsey, had come up with an idea for a new social communication product that turned into Twitter. Ev, Jack, and Biz Stone (another employee at Odeo) were considered the founders of the new effort, and the team raised money from both existing investors (some of whom passed on the new company) and new investors. The rest is history.<br /><br />The benefit of a true restart is it cleans up a lot of potential issues. For example, if existing investors don't believe in the new product direction they have a way to partially cash-out out in an up-front and positive manner.&nbsp; This gives the founders a clean cap table, rewards investor and employee loyalty, and also allows you to stop working with the people who do not believe anymore.<br /><br /><b>C. Things To Manage During A Pivot</b><br />Pivots are stressful times. If your first product is not working you will need to manage multiple parties to make the transition. Sometimes a pivot will blow up due to ongoing fighting between founders, or with an unruly or angry investor.<br /><br /><b>Founder conflicts.</b><br />The two biggest <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/05/4-ways-startups-fail.html\">ways early stage companies die</a> is by running out of money and founder conflicts. During a pivot, the optimal situation is that founders continue to work well together, and if one person is in charge she stays in charge. However, pivots tend to be stressful enough that founder agreements (\"you are the final decision maker\") may fall apart leading to infighting and an inability to move forward. Often if this happens one of the founders needs to leave.<br /><br /><b>Employee moral.</b><br />During a pivot some employees may rally and do whatever they can to help the company make it through a rough transition. Other employees may become fearful or anxious or lose belief in the company. While you may be able to soothe nerves, it is hard to regain belief. It might be best for all parties if non-believing employees move on to another opportunity if they are no longer pulling for the company. If needed, you may need to do a layoff to conserve cash during a pivot as well as remove unengaged team members.<br /><br /><b>Investor Unhappiness.</b><br /><div>Some investors may get upset of unhappy during a pivot. There are a number of reasons for this. Investors may:</div><div><b>a. Feel misled</b>. If a funding round just happened and the company pivots right after, investors may feel that what they were pitched on and invested is very different from the company they now own part of.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>b. Worry about losing money.</b> A junior VC partner may worry they will loose their investment and their career may suffer. An angel may worry about losing their investment (in which case they should not have invested in a startup). Non-bought in, worried people tend to become hard to work with.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>c. May wish the CEO / founders had executed better. </b>Sometimes investors interpret a pivot as the founders being weak. This is usually driven by having a VC who has never started a company and does not understand the reality of a startup. Or the CEO may indeed be weak. Alternatively, the investor may think the new idea or direction is a bad one, and feel trapped along for the ride.</div><div><br />To address investor concerns you should try to bring your investors along on the new direction early in the process. If they drag their feet and are truly unhappy with the new direction, you can propose a restart of the company (see above), a buyout of investors who do not want to be involved anymore, or try to sell the company.<br /><br /></div><div><b>Customer confusion.</b></div>If the company does a poor job of shutting down old products or communicating what is happening, the company's customers may be confused about what the company is doing. This is especially bad if new customers are confused and suggests the startup has not made a strong enough break with the past (i.e. changing old website content, creating sub brands, or the like). On average, founders err too often on the side of keeping a legacy product alive in order to save face or for optionality, when in reality they should make the hard decision early to shut it down and move on.<br /><br />While pivots can be challenging for early stage startups, sometimes they can lead to great outcomes for everyone involved. The key is to manage the various stakeholders (co-founders, employees, investors, customers) through the transition, let go of your legacy past, and focus on creating a bright new company and bright new future.<br /><br /><b>NOTES</b><br />[1] Honestly, the biggest takeaway on pivoting is that you should back any Stewart Butterfield gaming company, with the hope it eventually pivots.

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Over the last few years the number of people and businesses online has ballooned. Spend on the Internet has grown rapidly as you can now reach billions of people, and hundreds of millions of businesses, in a frictionless way. While in the late 1990s people were scared to put their credit card number into a website, today people use their phones to pay grocery stores and order Ubers. Growth of the internet has spilled over to all classes of software including enterprise SaaS and SMB segments.<br /><br />This in turn has yielded much larger outcomes than anyone expected for online software companies. The large IPOs of the last year, and the ongoing growth and scaling of prior generation SaaS companies, reflects massive growth and scale of the internet and its usage.<br /><br />Market caps of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/levynews/status/1121444080544673796\">some SaaS companies</a>:<br /><br />Salesforce: $120B&nbsp; <br />Workday: $44B<br />Atlassian: $29B<br />Shopify: $29B<br />Stripe (private): $22.5B<br />Zoom: $19B<br />Twilio: $16B<br />Okta: $11B<br />Dropbox: $10B<br />Slack (private): $7B (TBD as public company)<br />Github (acquired for $7.5B)<br /><br />A similar trends has existed in consumer companies, with a recent slate reaching massive market caps:<br />Google - $809B<br />Facebook - $539B<br />Uber (private for one more day) - $80B<br />Twitter- $29B<br />Lyft - $15B<br />Pinterest - $15B<br /><br />In general, software markets and businesses are 10X bigger than they were 10-15 years ago. This is due to the liquidity provided by the global internet. A company that would have been a $10-$20M subscale revenue business is now a $100M revenue company, which means many more companies can now be worth $1B or more, and many more SaaS businesses have the potential to be $10B+.<br /><br />This post reviews some of the numbers showing how much larger the internet is now than it used to be, then the implications for startups and their eventual market caps, and geographic distribution.<br /><br />First some background.<br /><br /><b>1. Markets Are Bigger Than Ever In The History Of Humanity.</b><br />The images below are all taken from the Internet Trends slides from <a href=\"https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/internet-trends-report-2017/\">2017</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/internet-trends-report-2018/\">2018</a>.<br /><br />Point 1: There are now &gt;3.5 billion people online.

Since online markets are bigger than ever, more $1B to $10B software companies can exist.</b><br />A big side effect of humanity-scale adoption of the Internet is that businesses can get bigger, faster, then ever before with the internet as the catalyst. Never before have so many people been so accessible in a low cost, low friction manner. This means startups and products can be adopted faster than ever.<br /><br />The old standard for a software as a services (SaaS) company to go public was $100M in annual recurring revenue, which would imply a $1 billion market cap assuming a reasonable ongoing growth rate.<br /><br /><b>a. There will be more $1B to $10B+ software companies.</b><br />In the past, many niche software companies would tap out at $20M to $50M in revenue. Since markets online are 5-10X bigger than they used be, these same companies will now scale to $100M+ in revenue and a $1B+ market cap. Companies that in the past would have been a $1B market cap company, are suddenly supporting $10B to $20B market caps per the current slate of IPOs.<br /><br />This does not mean there will be more outliers worth $100 billion or more, but rather that the base revenue a random company can achieve is a few fold higher than just a few years ago due to the growth and liquidity of the Internet.<br /><br /><b>b. While tech clusters will only grow in importance, there will be more $1B+ companies outside of tech clusters.</b><br />Since \"niche\" software companies can now reach $100M revenue scale more easily, there will be more $1B market cap companies outside of the major tech cities (Bay Area, Bangalore, Beijing, etc.).<br /><br />This will be confused in popular press and media as \"you can start a tech company anywhere\" (true) and \"Silicon Valley is over\" (false). While you can start a $1B+ company most places due to the recent mega scale of the internet, it does not negate the network effect that a tech cluster, or industry town like Silicon Valley has (more on this in a future blog post). The true outlier $10B to $100B+ companies will continue to be started in tech clusters like the (San Francisco) Bay Area, Bangalore, and Beijing (the \"3 Bs of tech\").<br /><br /><b>3. Startup Companies Will Grow Faster Than Ever</b><br />The growth rate of a company is really just a reflection of its market size and ability to scale its go-to-market. In other words, how many people can I reach in a repeatable fashion? Given the scale and liqudity of reaching people online, and their willingness to buy good and services via the web, companies can now grow to massive scale faster than ever. Not only will companies be bigger than ever, they can get there faster.<br /><br />Slack is a good example of rapid ramp by a SaaS company. \"Bottoms up\" distribution, where any employee with a credit card can buy a SaaS service will also accelerate new SaaS adoption.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fPU9YXt3Ing/XNRX1NW-cfI/AAAAAAAAGVo/7xe2s-D9eYYdsltqHaJiA95bmbr6xwThwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-09%2Bat%2B9.38.29%2BAM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fPU9YXt3Ing/XNRX1NW-cfI/AAAAAAAAGVo/7xe2s-D9eYYdsltqHaJiA95bmbr6xwThwCLcBGAs/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-09%2Bat%2B9.38.29%2BAM.png\" width=\"273\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">Note - this trend also holds for DTC product adoption acceleration (see image below).</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BONdmgrtok0/XNRcBOPJ1WI/AAAAAAAAGV8/VnMKJSFx87ELUg8xTV89pRD0OgAc_RrPACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-08%2Bat%2B9.04.17%2BPM.png\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BONdmgrtok0/XNRcBOPJ1WI/AAAAAAAAGV8/VnMKJSFx87ELUg8xTV89pRD0OgAc_RrPACLcBGAs/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-08%2Bat%2B9.04.17%2BPM.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><b>3.

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">A major trend of the last few years has been the rise of first time founders (or ones early in their startup career) investing their own, or scout fund money, into other startups. In the past, many founders would not become angels until they had either a prior exit under their belt (and therefore cash to invest) or the company was many years into its journey and they were far enough along to have a large salary or some <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2014/01/how-to-sell-secondary-stock.html\">secondary-stock-sale-based</a> liquidity. Many early founders are now being given their own micro venture funds, or money from other funds to invest.<br /><br />For founders starting to invest, there are a few key things to consider:<br /><br /><b>A. Being A Good Angel Investor Takes Time</b><br />Part of being a founder CEO is spending time with other entrepreneurs. Founders often exchange tips on hiring, distribution and other areas, gossip about which investors are good or bad, or provide each other with moral support or cross-coaching [1]. The nice thing about founder to founder time is it is optional. If you get really busy, you can more or less drop these activities.<br /><br />If you are an angel, you are pledging time and help to the people you back. While not all angels are able to help all the founders they fund, you should generally pick up the phone if they call or reply to emails and asks.<br /><br />When you have 1 or 2 or 4 companies you are involved with as an investor, it does not feel like a big load. You can manage the interactions with a limited set of investments. Once this number gets to 10 or more companies, it really starts to add up. While 1-2 companies is a hobby, &gt;10-20 companies starts to feel like a part time or even full time job (depending on how involved you are).<br /><br />Companies you back will need help with <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2010/03/7-types-of-angel-investors-what-is.html\">fundraising, people issues, hiring, M&amp;A offers, and other events</a>. Angel investing can start eating into your time in a deep way. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1112368653503074304\">The extra hour </a>you should be spending on your own company to work on the strategy roadmap you keep procrastinating on will suddenly go to help a founder instead. The default path may become to pick up the phone to help a founder, which is easier to do than focusing on your own startup work.<br /><br />The best way to counter this time sink and mode switching is a few fold:<br /><br /><b>1. Is now the time to start investing? What do you hope to get out of it?</b><br />Is it worth waiting on your company hitting some moment of momentum before starting to give others advice and capital? Is now the right time for you to invest your own money or that of a scout program (or raise a fund)?<br /><br />In my case I took a small number of advisory roles while starting my first company (MixerLabs, acquired by Twitter) but did not do much real investing (in part for focus, and in part because I didn't have much money). I am not sure if scout programs had been more extensive then if I would have participated, it is quite possible I would have - however I am happy I had time to focus on my first company. Startups are always hard, and first time startups are extra hard. By the time of my second company I had been investing for a few years and continued to actively do so.<br /><br />The positives of investing include giving back to others, broadening your network, information access (for example, what new distribution approaches are working for others), and the potential for financial return (although you should plan to lose any personal money you invest - so do not invest if you can not afford to lose the money)[2]. The cons include investing can become a big distraction, can irritate your cofounders or employees if a lot of your time goes to it (and your startup is not working), and the potential to lose money.<br /><br /><b>2. Time box investing.</b><br />If you do decide to invest, carve out the time you are going to spend on investing and stick to it. Is it every Tuesday and Thursday night? Your Saturdays? <b>Treat it like a hobby</b>. If you would not drop out of work mid day regularly to go do yoga teacher training or collect model trains[3], maybe you should not spend that same time on other people's startups. Your own startup should come first.<br /><br /><b>3. Set expectations up front.</b><br />Give founders you back realistic expectations - how fast can you reply to calls/text/emails? Are you only available to meet live certain nights and weekends? Or just breakfasts? You can <a href=\"http://growth.eladgil.com/book/the-role-of-the-ceo/insights-working-with-claire/\">write a guide to working with you</a> as one approach.<br /><br /><b>4. Don't spray and pray.</b><br />The more investments you make the harder it will be to manage time. Make sure each incremental investment is better than the average of all investments you have made so far. If you are not moving the average up with each investment you are probably investing badly (or your first two investments were Stripe and Airbnb).<br /><br /><b>5. Focus on investments that will come to you, versus hunting.</b><br />If you have just left a key network (Stripe, Facebook, etc.) to start a company, you are part of a unique cohort. Lots of your friends are probably also starting companies and you know who is good. Similarly, if you work in Fintech or another market, you will know who the best companies and founders are in your market. Invest in people or products you already know, do not need to diligence as deeply, and who you planned to help or informally advise anyhow. This will be differentiated access and also will prevent investing from becoming a massive time suck.<br /><br /><b>6. If you get extra busy, stop investing.</b><br />If your startup goes through an especially intense period, you will need to put investing (and all hobbies) on hold. If you are investing your own money, it is easy to ramp things up and down. If you are in a scout program or have raised your own angel fund, make sure expectations are set that there may be long periods of time (even years) when you may go dormant. One way to avoid pressure to invest is not take a management fee, or only take fees on capital you have deployed. No matter how you do it, make sure you can pull the breaks if needed.<br /><br /><b>B. Scout Programs and Your Personal Track Record: It is not free money!</b><br />In the last 5 years, a large number of venture funds have started scout programs, in which they give a set of founders or executives money to invest on their behalf. For example, a VP engineering at a company may be given $100,000 by a venture fund to invest, with the VP and the venture fund splitting the upside. Some scout programs have gotten quite large, with one notable one including 30+ of people.<br /><br />I have heard a number of people in scout programs say that they treat scout money as pure optionality - they have no personal skin in the game - so they do not diligence or really care where the money is going. One person told me \"I like to learn new things, so the scout money allows me to pay to learn something - its not my money so its OK.\" Another told me \"I am investing in my friend's company which isn't great, but its scout money so it doesn't matter\".<br /><br /><b>While not all scouts think this way, some do. So it is important to&nbsp;consider a few things when investing other people's money:</b><br /><br /><b>1. You are building an investor track record. Don't ruin it early.</b><br />While you might not realize it now, if you ever want to become a professional investor (raise a fund or SPV, or join a venture firm), people will want to see your track record. If you invest badly as a scout it may be hard for you to do either of these things. Effectively you are destroying your reputation as a good picker of companies by thinking the scout money is free. Reputation is the highest value thing you own. Is it worth trading future reputation and opportunities for a $10K check in a bad company?<br /><br />Similarly, other investors look to your portfolio as a quality signal of referrals you make. If you angel invest in a lot of bad companies early, VCs will be less likely to react quickly to companies you refer for series A or B. Effectively, people will view your past taste as a guide to your future referrals.<br /><br />This means you should not treat scout money as free money. Rather you should view it as a way to generate returns for yourself and for the fund that is backing you. You should also view it as the track record you are laying down that create optionality for you to some day join a venture fund or start your own fund.<br /><br /><b>2. You are a fiduciary of someone else's money.</b><br />If someone gives you money to invest, the goal is to make them money. The venture capital funds themselves raise their money from large institutional endowments, family offices, and other sources. For example, the dollars you are investing may ultimately belong to a teacher's pension fund, or an anti-cancer philanthropy. Your goal should be to make these institutions money to keep them funded.<br /><br />Some scout programs are nuanced in that venture funds are using scout programs to build information access and network. However, if you make people money they tend to like you more than if you don't. If you want to eventually work at a venture fund, the VC partners will look at your scout track record.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval\">Naval Ravikant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/garrytan\">Garry Tan</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Suhail\">Suhail Doshi</a> for feedback on this post.<br /><br /><b>NOTES</b><br />[1] In general I have found founder to founder coaching to be dramatically better than most self styled executive coaches. A few are actually good, but I would make sure to define what you plan to get out of the hiring of one.<br /><br />[2] Most founders I know eventually end up with a tight circle of other founders they are quite close to and speak to each other very regularly (in some cases more or less daily or weekly). So informal founder to founder networks are quite strong and can provide the network and information access without the investment. That said, some founders have made more money from a friends startup as an advisor or investor than from their own.<br /><br />[3] I do not know anyone who collects trains, so it is a hypothetical.<br /><br />[4] You can also see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1112055520548904960\">this Twitter thread</a> started by @suhail.<br /><br /><b>RELATED POSTS</b><br /><b style=\"background-color: white;

When in doubt talk to a trusted angel or advisor. If you are in YC, talk to your YC partner (they see a ton of parallel fundraises!) to get another view.</li><li>If your company does well, you will be working with your investors for the next 5-10 years. As such, you should optimize for (i) who can help your company and (ii) who you have good personal chemistry with. It is a long road.</li><li>Over optimizing for valuation and brand tends to be a common first time founder thing. The specific partner at a fund, or set of angels you work with is more important than a bit more dilution or a brand name firm with a partner you don't really gel with.</li><li>In reality, there is not that big a difference between SAFE notes and equity raises. SAFEs tend to be easier and faster and most (probably 70-80%) of seed companies do those. But an equity raise is OK too.</li><li>Ask your investors to commit time to help as part of their investment. Even the busiest people are more likely to carve out time to help you if you ask as part of them investing.</li><li>You usually do not give up a board seat for a seed round, and almost always do for a series A. If you add a board member, make sure to vet them with other founders. In particular focus on how they help, and also how they act if things go badly.</li></ul><b><br /></b><b>2.

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Every year I take a step back and ask if there are common themes in technology. Sometimes this creates a very backwards looking view, as the most obvious signals are in companies that have been working well for a few years and the trend is really over. Other times the signal turns out to be false or speculative. Many people five or six years ago probably thought consumer IoT was going to be driven by startups-when in reality big companies have been the key for most (but not all) consumer IoT applications.<br /><br />Here are some areas I think are especially intriguing for 2019:<br /><br /><b>1. Devsumer* Products. </b><i>AKA Software Eating Accenture.</i><br />One past wave of technology innovation was the rise of the professional &amp; consumer market for tech, or the \"prosumer\" market. We are now seeing a new merger of the developer &amp; consumer markets, or \"devsumer\".<br /><br />If you are an operations or business team at a tech company, or basically anybody at a non-tech company, it is hard to get any engineering resources to help build the workflow or productivity tools you need to be successful. Companies will spend hundreds of thousands, to literally hundreds of millions of dollars, <a href=\"https://www.govconwire.com/2017/01/fbi-selects-accenture-for-potential-100m-hr-application-services-bpa/\">hiring the Accentures</a> of the world to build simple applications and tools, or to perform API integrations for them.<br /><br />In parallel, the average knowledge worker has gotten more savvy and hands on. A lot more people have grown up with a computer in the home, <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2017/04/cis-coding-intro\">have taken a CS class in college</a> (now the most popular major at a number of universities), or gone to a coding bootcamp or school like <a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\">Lambda School</a>. While not all people exposed to CS end up as full-fledged developers, people on average are more savvy about elements of software and simple code. People are more willing to build things, if they have simple tools available.<br /><br />Just as there was a prior prosumer wave as part of IT productivity 1.0, we are experiencing a new \"devsumer\" wave, where consumers are more likely to take on lighter versions of developer-like work and products.<br /><br />A number of products have emerged that allow people to build simple software applications, or to use templated applications for their own work flow or productivity. You can think of this as taking a SQL database or excel spreadsheet and turning it into an app platform. These companies include <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">Airtable</a>&nbsp;and, in a vertical way specific to internal tools,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tryretool.com/\">Retool</a>.<br /><br />In a different market segment,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Getting-Started-ad338cf8ddb04651a052710ff7c6dc46\">Notion</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://coda.io/\">Coda</a>&nbsp;are focused on the future of docs &amp; productivity software, while other companies, such as <a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps\">Zapier</a> and <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a> allow you to simply stitch together APIs into workflows. There is the old saying that money is made by either bundling or unbundling products or services. Devsumer companies are virtually re-bundling disparate productivity tools into single companies.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2WqVfiKLbH0/XAYVM4eRr8I/AAAAAAAAGBk/ko0We_PRdpEUdEqP_kZexWrk8OJXnHwnQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-12-03%2Bat%2B9.48.18%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2WqVfiKLbH0/XAYVM4eRr8I/AAAAAAAAGBk/ko0We_PRdpEUdEqP_kZexWrk8OJXnHwnQCLcBGAs/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-12-03%2Bat%2B9.48.18%2BPM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />By allowing any person to either use an off the shelf template or tool, or create their own by stitching together existing applications, the power of programming is suddenly available to anyone in an enterprise or SMB. These tools can also be used for personal productivity or enterprise productivity.<br /><br />Devsumer products are driven by multiple megatrends including the overall shift to cloud based applications and platforms leading to accessible APIs for integrations plus a savvier white collar workforce that expects software tools to be an integral part of their work and personal lives.<br /><br />There will be multiple $5B+ companies in this market (with Airtable already raising a round at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/airtable-maker-of-a-coding-platform-for-non-techies-raises-100m-at-a-1-1b-valuation/\">$1.1B valuation</a>).<br /><b><br /></b><b>2. Real estate tech.</b>&nbsp;<i>Software eating real estate.</i><br />One of the largest TAMs in the world is real estate and much of an individuals' net worth is tied up in their home. In some sense,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;was one of the earliest real estate tech disruptors in that it allowed people to monetize their most expensive asset by renting it out to others.<br /><br />A new wave of real estate technology companies have emerged with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.opendoor.com/\">Opendoor</a>&nbsp;at the vanguard. Real estate technology companies are experimenting with fractional ownership (<a href=\"https://www.divvyhomes.com/\">Divvy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://harbor.com/\">Harbor</a>), new ways to build homes and neighborhoods (<a href=\"http://mosaic-builders.com/\">Mosaic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.katerra.com/\">Katerra</a>) and new ways to find rentals (<a href=\"https://bungalow.com/\">Bungalow</a>). There are also multiple services for home buying finally moving online - for example <a href=\"https://www.qualia.com/\">Qualia</a> for real estate closings or <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/\">Compass</a>, which has been buying local real estate brokerages in a hybrid online/offline model.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g3O_IsGWwKA/XAYPKuW7dZI/AAAAAAAAGBY/Cb25jXfkn40G3AcuvJ0moiJY6htDXwjvACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-12-03%2Bat%2B9.22.34%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g3O_IsGWwKA/XAYPKuW7dZI/AAAAAAAAGBY/Cb25jXfkn40G3AcuvJ0moiJY6htDXwjvACLcBGAs/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-12-03%2Bat%2B9.22.34%2BPM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><b><br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />3. Machine learning / AI silicon &amp; systems.</b>&nbsp;<i>Every major technology shift creates a $20B+ semiconductor company.</i><br />Most major technology waves result in a new $10B+ semiconductor company. For example, the rise of the microcomputer led to <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/\">Intel</a> and AMD, networking to <a href=\"https://www.broadcom.com/\">Broadcom</a>, graphics processing and video games to <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\">NVIDIA</a>, while mobile technologies resulted in <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/\">Qualcomm</a> and ARM.<br /><br />Machine learning / AI is a new technology wave with its own silicon &amp; hardware needs. While NVIDIA GPUs are used today by many in machine learning, the underlying hardware is not optimized for the fast I/O and matrix multiplication that would optimize for machine learning. Google launched custom ASICs for ML called <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/\">TPUs</a> (tensor processing units) but Google is unwilling to sell the hardware externally - in part to give its own cloud services a competitive advantage. This, plus the potential medium term rise of potentially ubiquitous AI models running in autonomous vehicles (self driving cars, drones etc.) yields a massive market opportunity**.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mC14vope7n8/XAAkmQkuiJI/AAAAAAAAGAs/Jppvk_zFYSoSvgogbeiRMrWjNQVLUqQiQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-11-29%2Bat%2B9.40.08%2BAM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mC14vope7n8/XAAkmQkuiJI/AAAAAAAAGAs/Jppvk_zFYSoSvgogbeiRMrWjNQVLUqQiQCLcBGAs/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-11-29%2Bat%2B9.40.08%2BAM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>Companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cerebras.net/\">Cerebras</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groq.com/\">Groq</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.graphcore.ai/\">Graphcore</a>, and others are potential contenders for ML market cap.<br /><div><br /></div><b>4. Transportation and logistics.&nbsp;</b><i>Software eating transportation, logistics, and supply chain.</i><br />The way physical goods will be moved around the world is changing. The entire transportation and logistics stacks is being eaten by software. The base layer for this - autonomous vehicles is still years away from the mainstream, but has promising early signals. Companies like <a href=\"https://embarktrucks.com/\">Embark</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kodiak.ai/\">Kodiak</a>, <a href=\"https://www.starsky.io/\">Starsky</a> and others are building self driving trucks. On top of this, firms like <a href=\"https://convoy.com/\">Convoy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uberfreight.com/\">Uber</a> are building load market places and logistics networks for trucking while <a href=\"https://keeptruckin.com/\">KeepTruckin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsara.com/\">Samsara</a> deal with fleet management and compliance. Companies like <a href=\"https://www.flexport.com/\">Flexport</a> are driving global freight. New robotics companies are trying to automate the warehouse and allow for small urban distribution centers (<a href=\"https://www.cs-robotics.com/\">CommonSense Robotics</a>). Finally, companies like <a href=\"https://goshippo.com/\">Shippo</a>&nbsp;help with the end user shipping process.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zwOJeJApjmo/XAYVe3MhnvI/AAAAAAAAGBs/bciwcz7gMwsMomL8HLaDmU_bL332yNv0QCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-12-03%2Bat%2B9.49.28%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"211\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zwOJeJApjmo/XAYVe3MhnvI/AAAAAAAAGBs/bciwcz7gMwsMomL8HLaDmU_bL332yNv0QCLcBGAs/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-12-03%2Bat%2B9.49.28%2BPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>5. Crypto.&nbsp;</b><i>Programmable money and Store of Value.</i><br />Cryptocurrencies and the underlying set of companies creating the new financial stack promise to be incredibly valuable. Bitcoin and Ethereum still hold immense promise as new forms of programmable money / store of value, in part due to their resistance to seizure and censorship. Despite the crypto winter, new protocols like Chia, Celo, Coda, Oasis, and Thunder are looking to re-invent compute and money while protocols like <a href=\"https://dirtprotocol.com/\">DIRT</a> ask how to move data onto the blockchain. While a subset of these approaches will undoubtedly fail, there is immense room for innovation.<br /><br />In parallel, a new financial stack is being build to to trade, custody, and derivative crypto in the form of <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/\">Coinbase</a>, <a href=\"https://anchorage.com/\">Anchorage</a>, and <a href=\"https://dydx.exchange/\">dYdX</a> with Coinbase acting as one of the very regulatory compliant fiat/crypto on ramps. In parallel, efforts to create new ways to securitize hard assets (Harbor) or for capital formation (<a href=\"https://coinlist.co/\">Coinlist</a>) are driving other aspects of the early market forward.<br /><br />I am still quite bullish that a basked of cryptocurrencies will be worth in the trillions within the next 10 years. The primary short term driver for crypto value with be the generational replacement of gold as a store-of-value for a specific subset of the population. The longer term drivers of crypto value will be new forms of programable money and on-chain securities.<br /><i><br /></i><b>6. TBD: Legal tech.</b>&nbsp;<i>Software eating law firms.</i><br />While more nascent, a new wave of companies are focused on eating away at the legal world. <a href=\"https://www.atrium.co/\">Atrium</a> is the world's first tech-driven law firm, while companies like <a href=\"https://www.klaritylaw.com/\">Klarity</a> apply machine learning to legal contracts. In parallel, <a href=\"https://stripe.com/atlas\">Stripe's Atlas</a> allows companies to incorporate via API. <a href=\"https://carta.com/\">Carta</a> provides cap table management as a basis to branch into other services. It is early days in legal tech but it is possible these early seeds will form deep roots.<br /><br />Given the degree to which legal services have a series of highly repetitive tasks that lawyers and para-legals would prefer not to do, it is surprising more software has not come to this vertical.<br /><i><br /></i><b>7. TBD: Defense?</b>&nbsp;<i>Big company employee politics creating a market opportunity.</i><br />Silicon Valley has its roots in the defense industry. A good overview may be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://steveblank.com/secret-history/\">with Steve Blank</a>. The recent Trump election helped to further radicalize US politics and this political divide has found its way Silicon Valley as well. While a strong national defense matters for the USA irrespective of who the president is, it is suddenly unpopular at a number of companies to accept defense related work. Google shut down <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html\">project Maven</a> which met with a negative employee response, and employees have protested defense contractors at Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others.<br /><br />The rise of the radicalized worker has created an opportunity for startups to pursue defense work. The defense and intelligence community wants to work with major brands like Google. However, if Google is unwilling to lend its AI expertise, for example, to assess defense video feeds, startups will emerge take on this work.<br /><br />To date, <a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/\">Anduril</a> may be the defense company with the most interest although others like <a href=\"http://shield.ai/\">Shield.AI</a> are also in the market. There is an opportunity here to build a next-generation defense company.<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />In sum, there are 5 core markets (Devsumer, Real Estate, AI hardware, Transportation and Logistics, Crypto) and 2 emerging ones (Legal, Defense) that seem quite exciting to watch in 2019.

Oy vey startups are hard!”.</span></div><div class=\"p2\"><span><br /></span></div><div class=\"p1\"><span>The High Growth Handbook is based on my experiences working with companies post product-market fit as they scaled from a handful of engineers, and maybe a business person or designer, to multi-hundred or multi-thousand person organizations. The book covers topics like the role of the CEO, hiring and managing an executive team, doing re-orgs, managing your board of directors, buying other companies, raising late stage rounds, and the development of new functional areas like product management, marketing, and PR.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class=\"p2\"><span><br /></span></div><div class=\"p1\"><span>My own frameworks, observations, and tactical advice[1] reflected in the book are complemented by interviews with some of the leading operators and investors in tech.

Rather, you can flip to a specific section that may be relevant to something your company is grappling with, or read through all the interviews at once. Justin Kan summarized it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1017592420396163078\"><span class=\"s1\">nicely on Twitter</span></a>.</span></div><div class=\"p2\"><span><br /></span></div><div class=\"p1\"><span>In the book, I steered away from the canned, generic, useless advice found in your average business book like “A players hire A players”. I also avoided writing a 500 page book on a single concept. Instead I focused on detailed tactics for how to scale recruiting or what specifically to look for in executives. One key thing to keep in mind as you read this book—all startup advice needs to be filtered through the unique context of your own situation or company. The only good generic startup advice is “there is no good generic startup advice”.</span></div><div class=\"p2\"><span><br /></span></div><div class=\"p1\"><span>The book is being published by Stripe, and in particular, a new experimental publishing imprint called <a href=\"https://press.stripe.com/\"><span class=\"s1\">Stripe Press</span></a>. Stripe was a natural fit as a publisher given their focus on helping entrepreneurs to start and scale enduring companies. My hope is that the High Growth Handbook can be of use to entrepreneurs, investors, and people working at startups around the world. I am excited to be the first in what may end up being a long line of books about startups, business, and self learning—all crucial when kicking off a new enterprise.</span></div><div class=\"p2\"><span><br /></span></div><div class=\"p1\"><span>Thank you to all the startups, founders, and investors, who have been kind enough to let me be part of their journey.

I sold my first startup, MixerLabs, to Twitter when Twitter was just ~90 people, and left the company at around 1500 employees. I am also an investor in companies like Airbnb, Coinbase, Gusto, Instacart, Stripe, Square, Pinterest, Wish, Zenefits and others. In some cases I invested as early as just the founder(s), and in others later in the life of the company.</span></div><br /></div>~\n",
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>As a company scales the number of meetings initially grows faster then headcount. With more people comes more coordination. Most companies have bad meeting etiquette, which means an enormous amount of time is wasted. The following steps help increase meeting efficiency:</span><br /><span><br /></span><b><span>1. Determine who is necessary in the meeting.</span></b><br /><span>Are there really 20 people needed in the room? Separate the must haves, from the nice to haves, from the politically expedient to be there.</span><br /><span><br /></span><b><span>2. Send out an agenda in advance.</span></b><br /><span>What will be discussed? How much time do you really need to spend per topic? Maybe the 60 minute meeting should really be 30 minutes? Like wedding planning, meetings fill the time available to them.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Similarly, what preparation should people do in advance? Is there a document to pre-read or data to look at in advance so people come prepared?</span><br /><span><br /></span><b><span>3. Set up (projecting, hangout or conference line, etc.) in advance if you can.</span></b><br /><span>If you are running the meeting and are able to do so, arrive in advance. Dial into the conference line or start the Hangout and start projecting. Instead of wasting 5 minutes in setup with 10 people there, do it early.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>If your conference rooms are always fully booked back to back (often the case as the fast growing companies are always running out of space), it is hard to get into the room 5 minutes early. Companies can facilitate this by having an :05 policy. I.e. meetings start at 2:05 but the meeting owner books the room starting at 2:00 so has 5 minutes to set up.</span><br /><span><br /></span><b><span>4. Kick off the meeting with objectives.</span></b><br /><span>Review the agenda and purpose of the meeting. Is it to make a decision on a product? To brainstorm a new feature? To review a sales pipeline and prioritize leads? If the meeting does not have a clear objective, you should cancel it. If the same topic is repeated over and over in a weekly meeting without progress, decide if escalation or another method of breaking a bottleneck is needed. The same meeting should not take place 5 times.</span><br /><span><br /></span><b><span>5. Assign a note taker.</span></b><br /><span>Who is responsible for taking notes in the meeting? Any meeting with more then 3-4 people should send out notes. The meeting owner can assign/delegate note taker up front.</span><br /><span><br /></span><b><span>6. Send out meeting notes.</span></b><br /><span>Meeting notes help the rest of the company know what was discussed or decided. It allows different stakeholders to follow up if they were unable to attend. Notes increase cross-company transparency dramatically [1].</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Meeting notes would optimally include:</span><br /><span>a. Subject/topic of meeting</span><br /><span>b. Date</span><br /><span>c. Attendees</span><br /><span>d. Actions/decisions</span><br /><span>e. Agenda</span><br /><span>f. Detailed notes</span><br /><span><span><br /></span><b><span>7. Clean up the meeting calendar ongoing.</span></b></span><br /><span>Unnecessary regular meetings accumulate like rust on a company. Ask all meeting owners to go through and kill meetings once a quarter. (a) What meetings are still necessary or useful? (b) Who should still attend? People can be dropped and added as well to rebalance who should attend.</span><br /><span><span><br /></span><b><span>NOTES</span></b></span><br /><span>[1] There may be legal reasons to not take notes in specific meetings. Consult with the company's GC or external counsel on training for meeting note etiquette.</span><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span><b style=\"background-color: white;\">MY BOOK</b></span></div><span><span style=\"background-color: white;\">You can&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/High-Growth-Handbook-Elad-Gil/dp/1732265100/\" style=\"background-color: white;\">pre-order the High Growth Handbook here</a><span style=\"background-color: white;\">.</span></span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span><br /></span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><b><span>RELATED POSTS</span></b></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><span><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2014/07/how-to-ask-for-introduction.html\">How To Ask For An Introduction</a></span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/08/ask-before-you-intro.html\">Ask Before You Intro - Avoiding Blind Intros</a></span></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/11/how-to-reply-to-angel-investor-intro.html\"><span>How To Reply To Investor Intros</span></a></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2015/05/investor-update-emails.html\"><span>Sending Investor Updates</span></a></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2014/12/founders-should-divide-and-conquer.html\"><span>Founders Should Divide And Conquer</span></a></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2010/09/put-your-investors-to-work-for-you.html\"><span>Put Your Investors To Work</span></a></div></div>~\n",
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the biggest shifts of the last 6 months is the degree to which pre-emptive <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/03/how-funding-rounds-differ-seed-series.html\">funding rounds</a> have become the new normal in Silicon Valley. While pre-emptive rounds used to be reserved for celebrity or serial entrepreneur founders, they have recently become almost the default for a subset of companies. I have seen multiple seed companies receive pre-emptive <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/03/tactics-for-how-to-raise-vc-round-or.html\">series A </a>fundings in the last few months without any specific milestones hit. Similarly, late stage companies like <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scooter-startup-bird-is-seeking-a-2-billion-valuation-1528813078-11187061-2a49-440c-a2e6-65e74faad5ec.html\">Bird</a> have seen their valuations skyrocket in the course of months or even weeks. Why all the fuss to pre-empt?<br /><br /><b>Traditional venture rounds track progress</b><br />In a typical venture financing the money is invested behind a big company milestone, or due to an ongoing business ramp. The later the round of funding, the more likely it is to reflect updated progress of a company hitting its user or revenue goals.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i0csxBEG99M/WzLVLDOS7xI/AAAAAAAAFtM/bwzfjcXV62ke0zYWtu_h04j7BBfcP5jqwCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-06-26%2Bat%2B5.06.17%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i0csxBEG99M/WzLVLDOS7xI/AAAAAAAAFtM/bwzfjcXV62ke0zYWtu_h04j7BBfcP5jqwCLcBGAs/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-06-26%2Bat%2B5.06.17%2BPM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><br />As an example, <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223310\">Instagram</a>'s March 2010 $500K seed round was at a valuation in the low millions. The investment was behind a team without a launched product.<br /><br />Instagram's February 2011 series A with Benchmark was in the mid-20 millions market cap which reflected a rapidly scaling, but newly launched, consumer product that had just launched. The launch of the product and early customer traction created a big step up in valuation from the seed round, which was an investment in a team.<br /><br />Sequoia's April 2012 $50M series B investment in Instagram at a $500M valuation was in a company that had continued to scale its userbase exponentially and whose growth was actually accelerating with scale. Future rounds for Instagram, had it not been bought by Facebook, would likely have tracked this exponential growth.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gFJ8HkERZuk/WzLV4ZnxbSI/AAAAAAAAFtk/ml0BDvswSWQB8Pqh4Rmq3n0PCEMUHVWDgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-06-26%2Bat%2B5.09.36%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gFJ8HkERZuk/WzLV4ZnxbSI/AAAAAAAAFtk/ml0BDvswSWQB8Pqh4Rmq3n0PCEMUHVWDgCLcBGAs/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-06-26%2Bat%2B5.09.36%2BPM.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Preemptive rounds are investments without a catalyst</b><br />In each financing round example above for Instagram, there was a clear change in progress or major milestone hit between rounds. In a pre-emptive round, there is no material change in progress between rounds. Rather, the investor is so excited to invest, or believes the company valuation should be much higher than the last investment, that she is willing to push up the company valuation without any new progress or information.<br /><br />Bird's latest rounds is a good example of pre-emption. While Sequoia led an investment in Bird at a $1 billion valuation, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scooter-startup-bird-is-seeking-a-2-billion-valuation-1528813078-11187061-2a49-440c-a2e6-65e74faad5ec.html\">it is rumored</a> Bird is closing another round at $2 billion just a few weeks later.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_tgxSJ1tfUc/WzLVQ7-tkzI/AAAAAAAAFtQ/jwn2BvzLOg8YxcjTRUFYrofFgq47VQnwACEwYBhgL/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-06-26%2Bat%2B5.06.25%2BPM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_tgxSJ1tfUc/WzLVQ7-tkzI/AAAAAAAAFtQ/jwn2BvzLOg8YxcjTRUFYrofFgq47VQnwACEwYBhgL/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-06-26%2Bat%2B5.06.25%2BPM.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><b>Why more pre-emption?</b><br />The trend to pre-emption is driven by a few factors:<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Outcomes are bigger then ever before.&nbsp;</b>Technology companies can now get bigger faster and reach billions of online customers faster then ever before. As outcomes get larger, a subset of later stage rounds remain attractive from a return or cash on cash multiple perspective.</li><li><b>\"Greed\" worked.</b>&nbsp; Alongside outcomes that are bigger then ever, a few VCs also continued to re-up or invest large checks in companies they backed. Investors realized that Airbnb at a $5 billion valuation was actually still a great investment, so why cede that round to new investors? Public successes like <a href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/in-whatsapp-deal-sequoia-capital-may-make-50-times-its-money/\">Sequoia with Whatsapp</a> and <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-buys-github-for-7-5-billion/\">A16Z with Github</a> showed that doubling down on the same companies can lead to outsized returns. This has led some venture funds to take the stance that they want to keep funding their winners the whole way, when before many funds stopped at the series B or C.</li><li><b>Bigger funds.</b> More VCs are raising funds over $1 billion in size including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/confirmed-sequoia-has-already-secured-three-quarters-of-what-will-be-an-8-billion-global-fund/\">Sequoia</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/general-catalyst-just-closed-its-biggest-fund-ever-as-firms-race-to-get-bigger-fast/\">General Catalyst</a> and others. Softbank's $100 billion fund is of course the extreme of this. With bigger funds two things happen: (i) VCs want to buy more of the companies they own as they need to own a bigger proportion of the best outcomes to make money on their funds and (ii) a $10 million check from a $1 billion fund is equivalent to a $3M check from a $300 million fund. In other words, a \"small check that gives you optionality\" is quite large for a megafund.</li><li><b>Fewer high quality companies.</b> The ratio of great to so-so companies has been on a negative slope from a qualitative perspective. If you ask the average investor today what are the new break out companies few would have a long list. This is particularly true of consumer where investors will quickly throw money at anything with a heartbeat and a handful of teenaged users. A lot of money is now chasing a few companies.&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><b>Implications</b><br />While some venture funds are pre-empting gracefully, others seem to be throwing money haphazardly at companies with the hope that if they pre-empt the next Uber, the other investments won't matter. Some funds will do extremely well due to pre-emption while others will see a big negative impact to their returns. Picking, as always, matters. Picking without more data is hard.<br /><br />From an entrepreneur's perspective, fast, cheap, and easy money with an investor you already know tends to be a good thing. In general, there are few negatives to a pre-emptive round from a founders perspective.<br /><br />However, if it is the same firm that has led one or more rounds in the past, there are deeper implications.<br /><b><br /></b><b>A founder's plusses of a pre-emptive round may include:</b><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Can stay focused on building a company. </b>Without having to go out to fundraise, founders can keep focused on building.</li><li><b>Board &amp; investor stability. </b>Typically, pre-emptive rounds do not include a change in your <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/12/how-to-choose-board-member.html\">board of directors</a>. Often a founder will take a preemptive round from an investor they already know and trust. In some cases, this will lead to a new board seat (e.g. when going from a seed to a series A) but it will be with someone the founder already wants to work with.</li></ul><b>A founder's negatives of a pre-emptive round with an existing investor may include:</b><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><b>Investor diversity.</b> Investors are there to help you build your company. If you do not add more investors, you will have a more limited network for hiring, future fundraises, or customer introductions.</li><li><b>Investor control.</b> As investors buy more of a company, they may effectively end up with control of multiple rounds of preferred of the company. Depending on the rights you give with each round, it might either benefit or harm the company to have control concentrated.</li><li><b>Fewer voices.</b>&nbsp;In general, keeping private boards small tends to be a good idea. If done right, you spend less time on board management and more time on building a company. However, having multiple board members and major investors sometimes leads to stronger discussion and richer ideas for the path a company should be on. Investors may end up balancing each other out with different voices optimizing for different approaches. Having a single large investor may negatively impact this positive dynamic if carried along for too many rounds.</li><li><b>Non-competitive round.</b> In general I would suggest a founder take terms that are good enough with investors they would be happy to work with for the next 10 years. Optimizing on valuation doesn't always yield the best outcomes. Pre-emptive rounds are definitionally non-competitive, so as a founder you may or may not get the best price for your round.</li></ul><b>MY BOOK</b><br />You can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/High-Growth-Handbook-Elad-Gil/dp/1732265100/\">pre-order the High Growth Handbook here</a>.<br /><b><br /></b><b>RELATED POSTS</b><br /><b><span style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\">Raising Money</span></b><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/02/dont-ask-for-too-much-money.html\"><span style=\"font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;\">Don't Ask For Too Much Money</span></a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/02/building-vc-relationships.html\" style=\"color: #771100;

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">As a market driven investor, I am skeptical of 99% of the crypto projects under development today. That said, there are a core set of use cases with massive market sizes that cryptocurrencies currently fill (and in some cases will soon fill)[0]:<br /><br /><b>1. Store of value (SoV) &amp; investment</b><br />A digital store of wealth such as bitcoin can have multiple advantages over traditional ones such as gold ($7 trillion plus asset), USD, art, or land. This includes seizure resistance (a badly acting government or thief will find it hard to steal) and ease of transport (cryptocurrencies allow you to cross a border with literally a billion dollars in your pocket or mind).<br /><br />This use case is already a real one for cryptocurrencies and generationally many millennials view cryptocurrencies as a digital asset to own. The primary drawback to cryptocurrencies as SoV is their volatility, which should decrease with adoption, liquidity, and derivatives. Until volatility decreases cryptocurrencies will still be used as an investable asset and partial store of wealth. Many people are willing to trade crypto price volatility for security or avoidance of high inflation in unstable economic or political regimes (see e.g. Venezuela). Similarly, some governments may want to hold assets divorced from the action or whim of other government-driven currencies. This is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.<br /><br /><b>2.&nbsp;</b><b>Offshore capital:&nbsp;</b><b>Private assets &amp; payments</b><br />Over <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2012/07/23/super-rich-hide-21-trillion-offshore-study-says/#688971706ba6\">$20 trillion dollars are believed to be stored in the Cayman Islands</a> and in Swiss bank accounts. These offshore accounts are used due to their discretion and privacy. Digital privacy tokens like Monero and Zcash will subsume this use case over time[1].<br /><br />On a related but different note, privacy tokens may be well optimized for grey or black market use cases. That said, it should be possible to build a privacy coin whose primary use case is discretion of assets (Cayman Islands/Swiss accounts) versus nefarious purposes (buying drugs online).<br /><br /><b>3. Money wrapped in code: Securitization platforms &amp; asset ledgers</b><br />A wide range of assets in the traditional financial system are value wrapped in contractual code - for example a stock certificate (or electronic form thereof) is really just contractual ownership of future cash flows or value of a company. Similarly, escrows, titles, loans, mortgages, trusts, wills, and derivatives are all value wrapped in contracts. Contracts are really an analog form of code. Smart contracting platforms like Ethereum, or regulatory compliant approaches like Harbor, are going to take analog contracts and convert them to digital ones.<br /><br />The nearest term example of this are ICOs, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/ico-contributions-in-2018-already-surpass-2017/\">$5.6 billion in ICOs</a>&nbsp;are thought to have been raised in early 2018. Many of the tokens sold in ICOs are ERC20 tokens based on the Ethereum smart contracting platform. This is the earliest large use case in the conversion of financial contracts into code running on a blockchain, as well as unlocking global 24/7 markets. Smart contracts today are most interesting in their ability to create massive crowdfunding markets for all types of assets.<br /><br /><b>4. Persistent digital goods</b><br />Adoption of ERC721 based persistent digital goods is early (see Cryptokitties), but this area will accelerate in the coming years as traditional gaming talent enters this market. This market will be smaller then the three other markets above, but it will be in the billions of dollars in its own right. Example applications may include games, esports, collectibles, and eventually fine art.<br /><br />In summary, there are multiple large, multi trillion dollar use cases for cryptocurrencies today as financial products to store wealth, to maintain privacy and discretion of assets, and to convert analog contracts to smart digital ones (money wrapped in code). Additional, a smaller but real use case exists in persistent digital goods on blockchain.<br /><br />Are there any markets I missed? Let me know on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eladgil\">Twitter</a>.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avichal\">Avichal Garg</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dksf\">David King</a> for comments on this post.<br /><br /><b>NOTES</b><br />[0] Payments are an obvious large use case cryptocurrencies were originally designed for. Bitcoin and Ethereum are used to buy into ICOs or to transact on exchanges today, while Monero is adopted on some grey or black market sites. However, high scale payments for cryptocurrencies have not taken off yet.&nbsp; Part of this is due to technical limiations (hooray for Lightning!), part of it is due to price volatility (hence the call for stable coins) and part of it is regulatory (tax code or other issues). I do think payments will be a major area in the future, however have focused this post on current or nearer term uses.<br /><br />I also think a lot of crypto projects are too early today. More of the technology and infrastructure in general need to be built out. Just as the first internet wave contained ideas that did not work out in one form, that came back and worked ten years later in another form (e.g. Webvan and Instacart), crypto will have similar failures today that will be successful 10 years later as a new approach.<br /><br />[1] You can also imagine e.g. integration of Bulletproofs, zk-STARKs or zk-SNKRs into bitcoin or other chains as well taking on this use case. For now it seems these may be different (but overlapping) use cases with different regulatory implications. There are also interesting new protocols like Grin and Signal is workin on Mobilecoin. This is an area to watch.<br /><br /><b>RELATED POSTS</b><br />Crypto:<br /><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2018/01/the-case-for-ethereum.html\">The Case For Ethereum</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/12/bitcoin-network-effects_11.html\" style=\"color: #771100; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Bitcoin Network Effects</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/10/cryptocurrency-incentives-and-corporate.html\" style=\"color: #771100; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Cryptocurrency Incentives and Corporate Structures</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/08/big-banks-and-blockchain.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #771100; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Big Banks and Blockchains</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/07/cryptocurrencys-netscape-moment.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #771100; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Cryptocurrency's Netscape Moment</a></li></ul><br /><div style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\"><div style=\"margin: 0px;\">Markets:</div><div style=\"margin: 0px;\"><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/07/end-of-cycle.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px; line-height: 20.79px;\">End of Cycle?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/08/startups-in-machine-learning-ai.html\" style=\"color: #771100; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Machine Learning Startups</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2015/01/the-3-types-of-platform-companies.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">3 Types Of Platform Companies</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2014/12/defensibility-and-lock-in-uber-lyft.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Defensibility and Lock-In: Uber and Lyft</a></li><li><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/19/uber-and-disruption/\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Uber And Disruption</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2013/04/who-cares-if-its-been-tried-before.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Who Cares If Its Been Tried Before?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/10/the-road-to-5-billion-is-long-one.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">The Road To $5 Billion Is A Long One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/10/how-to-win-as-second-mover.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">How To Win As Second Mover</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/09/enough-with-this-end-of-silicon-valley.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">End Of Silicon Valley</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2013/06/social-products.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Social Products</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2015/01/hot-markets-for-2015.html\" style=\"color: #992211; font-family: arial, tahoma, helvetica, freesans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Hot Markets For 2015</a></li></ul></div></div></div>~\n",
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">A startup CEO recently pinged me about an offer their company had received from a larger, fast growing, breakout company. He did not know how to assess the offer. Here are some of the components a founder should consider when receiving an offer from a breakout company:<br /><br /><h2><b>Financial considerations.</b></h2>If you have a $100 million offer from a break out company, it is actually worth a lot more. Considerations:<br /><br /><b>1. Company upside multiplier.&nbsp;</b><br />Suppose you had an offer from Airbnb a few years ago when it was worth $10 billion.&nbsp; If Airbnb ends up at its current valuation of ~$30 billion (I think it could be worth much more) then the $100 million offer may turn into $300 million or so at exit as Airbnb itself has grown 3X (ignoring dilution).<br /><br /><b>2. Dilution.</b><br />If instead of selling to Airbnb, you kept going as an independent company and needed to raise money, you would experience further dilution. For example if you still needed to raise a&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white;\"><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/03/how-funding-rounds-differ-seed-series.html\">series A, B, and C</a></span>&nbsp;and issue more options to employees, you may dilute another 30-50%. Assuming that you will dilute on the low end of this (e.g. 25%) you will have needed to exit on your own for $400 million later to achieve the equivalent of the $100 million exit to Airbnb in the past (3X multiple, and then 25% dilution). If you experience 50% dilution then the Airbnb offer was worth $600 million.<br /><br /><b>3. Risk adjusted time value.</b><br />One key element is timeline and risk. The average M&amp;A exit takes ~6 years from founding. During that time a lot can change in the industry. In parallel a Stripe or Airbnb has a dominant enough position that momentum will continue to carry them forward and likely increase valuation. This means that on a risk adjusted basis exiting to a breakout company is, for high dollar acquisition offers, the right thing to do. For a lower value offer (e.g. $5 million exit) depending on your financial situation it may make sense to keep going unless you are running out of money or energy.<br /><br />The decision in part depends on where the acquirer's own valuation is likely to go. For example, when we sold my last startup MixerLabs to Twitter we assumed the company had a 5-10X in upside as a minimum (it is now almost 20X more valuable).<br /><br /><b>4. Vesting.</b><br />The financial downside of an acquisition offers may lie in vesting. If you leave the company that buys you before you fully vest, you may lose much of the value of the acquisition. When thinking through the value of a purchase, you should consider whether the acquirer would truly be a long term home for you.<br /><br /><b>5. Other considerations.&nbsp;</b><br />Selling your company is not a purely financial decision. Impact your product could have on the world, the joy of building your own company (or selling and learning from others), who you get to work with, and other factors all matter. However, the purpose of this post is the financial aspects.<br /><br /><h2><b>Ease of sale</b></h2>Many founders fail to consider that the lower your valuation, the easier it is to sell your company. M&amp;A offers tend to fall into a set of ranges. The higher the range, the harder it is to exit and the fewer companies can afford you.<br /><br /><br /><ul><li><b>&lt;$20M.&nbsp;</b>Companies with $1 billion or more can make a fast decision to buy others in this range.</li><li><b>&lt;$100M.</b>&nbsp;Companies worth $5 billion or more can make a fast decision in this range. At less then $1 billion in valuation $50 million to $100 million equates to 10% of a company and is a major buy requiring a lot of agonizing and board discussion.</li><li><b>$100M to $250M.&nbsp;</b>OK for a $10 billion company but will take real discussion and back and forth. Only will happen if truly existential or strategic for a $1 billion company.</li><li><b>$250 to $500M.</b>&nbsp;At this point only companies worth $5 billion or more can even consider it, and you will generally need valuations above $10 billion in many cases to pull it off. This will require real debate. For a Google or Facebook scale company, some of these buys can still happen quickly as it is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/02/market-caps-2-rule.html\">small as a proportion of market cap</a>.</li><li><b>$1B+.&nbsp;</b>Acquisitions of this size are very rare and generally requires extensive discussion and few buyers can get there. In general you need to be worth tens of billions to buy a company worth a billions plus, and you must hold strategic value to the acquirer. Since exits of this size are broadly reported on they seem common. In reality billion dollar startup acquisitions are rare.</li></ul><div><br /></div><br /><h2><b>Example exits. Instagram versus Friendster.</b></h2>Both Instagram and Friendster were companies that had early acquisition offers. Friendster famously turned down a $30 million offer from Google in 2003 (probably worth billions today) and then eventually sold for $26 million in 2009 after raising tens of millions of dollars. While not selling Friendster at the time was the right decision given its traction, in hindsight enormous upside was lost for the founders. In contrast, Instagram sold to Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion. With Facebook's appreciation this is now many billions of dollars. However Instagram would probably be worth tens of billions today as a stand alone. One could argue Instagram sold too early, although the founders and investors obviously did well.<br /><br /><h2><b>RELATED POSTS</b></h2><b>M&amp;A</b><br /><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2017/02/market-caps-2-rule.html\">Market Caps and the 2% Rule</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/07/its-m-time-ipos-return-in-2018.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #771100; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Its M&amp;A Time!</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/08/what-is-your-startup-acquisition-offer.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px; line-height: 20.79px;\">What Is Your Startup Acquisition Really Worth?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/08/5-reasons-to-sell-your-startup.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px; line-height: 20.79px;\">5 Reasons To Sell Your Startup</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/01/m-ladder-position-your-startup-to-sell.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px; line-height: 20.79px;\">M&amp;A Ladder</a></li></ul><div><b>Markets</b></div><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/10/the-road-to-5-billion-is-long-one.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">The Road To $5 Billion Is A Long One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/07/end-of-cycle.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px; line-height: 20.79px;\">End of Cycle?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/08/startups-in-machine-learning-ai.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #771100; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Machine Learning Startups</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2015/01/the-3-types-of-platform-companies.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">3 Types Of Platform Companies</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2014/12/defensibility-and-lock-in-uber-lyft.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Defensibility and Lock-In: Uber and Lyft</a></li><li><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/19/uber-and-disruption/\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Uber And Disruption</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2013/04/who-cares-if-its-been-tried-before.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Who Cares If Its Been Tried Before?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/10/how-to-win-as-second-mover.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">How To Win As Second Mover</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/09/enough-with-this-end-of-silicon-valley.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">End Of Silicon Valley</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2013/06/social-products.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 20.79px;\">Social Products</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2016/01/waiting-too-long-to-go-public.html\" style=\"background-color: white; color: #992211; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;\">Waiting Too Long To Go Public</a></li></ul></div>~\n",
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Startups tend to succeed by building a product that is so compelling and differentiated that it causes large number of customers to adopt it over an incumbent. This large customer base becomes a major asset for the company going forward. Products can be cross sold to these customers, and the company's share of time or wallet can expand.<br /><br />Since focusing on product is what caused initial success, founders of breakout companies often think product development is their primary competency and asset. In reality, the distribution channel and customer base derived from their first product is now one of the biggest go-forward advantages and differentiators the company has.<br /><br />This pattern of distribution as moat and competitive advantage was used ruthlessly by the prior generation of technology companies. Microsoft bought or built multiple franchises including Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel were all stand alone companies or market segments), Internet Explorer, and other products and then pushed them down common business and consumer channels. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Cisco_Systems\">Cisco has purchased dozens of companies</a> that were then repositioned or resold to their enterprise and telecom channels. SAP and Oracle have exhibited similar patterns of success.<br /><br />Of the most recent crop of technology giants, Facebook and Google realized the power and importance of distribution early in their respective lives. While Google's reputation is that of organic growth, in reality the company bought placement on the Firefox homepage, as well as paid hundreds of millions of dollars per year to have Google search toolbars distributed via download with other applications. Google then used its search customer base to bootstrap other products and distribute Maps (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@lewgus/the-untold-story-about-the-founding-of-google-maps-e4a5430aec92\">Where2</a> acquisition), Gmail, Chrome, Docs (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2006/03/09/writely-confirms-google-acquisition/\">Writely</a> and other acquisitions), and other products. Similarly, Facebook invested heavily in growth efforts and acquired multiple companies for email scraping (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/19/octazen-what-the-heck-did-facebook-just-buy-exactly-and-why/\">Octazen</a>), low end feature phone distribution (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/20/facebook-reportedly-acquires-snaptu-for-an-estimated-60-70-million/\">Snaptu</a> acquisition) and other approaches. It then used this distribution to help accelerate acquisitions like Instagram to the global market.<br /><br />In all cases, the steps to success have been:<br />1. Build a product so good that customers will use you over an incumbent. Build a large userbase on the back of this first product.<br /><br />2. Be aggressive versus complacent about customer growth early. Outsized companies like Google, Facebook, and Uber were aggressive and calculated about growth from their earliest days. In contrast non-metric driven, less aggressive companies failed to reach the next level of success. Too many companies get complacent about distribution if their core product \"just works\".<br /><br />3. Realize your customer channels are a primary asset of the company. Build new products or buy companies and push them down your sales channel. Uber has been trying to do this more recently with Uber Eats and its Jump acquisition.<br /><br />4. Realize that your company will not be able to build everything itself. Buy more companies and push them down the channel. Most companies need to overcome internal resistance to buying companies. A common set of arguments are made about how easy it would be to build something in house instead, or integration challenges will be too hard. In reality, breakout companies never have enough resources to do everything and should buy more startups.<br /><br />The smartest companies realize they are also in the distribution business, and will buy (or build) and then redistribute a range of products.<br /><br /><div style=\"background-color: white;

For example a change within the structure of the sales team, versus changes across all teams simultaneously. Some teams such as sales are more likely to re-org frequently at that point as they scale, while others like product and engineering tend to be more stable. Part of this has to do with where head count grows and needs change most rapidly in a company as it switches from being solely product-centric, to focusing more on go to market. The biggest cross-company re-orgs later as the company scales will occur when changing product/engineering/go-to-market simultaneously, adding new product areas or acquisitions, if a company flips from a matrix to business unit-like organization, or flips between centralized and decentralized internationalization.</span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><br /></span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Early on, you as CEO will need to be adept at re-orgs.
