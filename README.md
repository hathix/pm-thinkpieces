## Running

I'm using `pipenv` to manage virtual environments. Run

```
pipenv --python 3.9
```

Then

```
pipenv shell
```

To get going. No need for manual virtualenv stuff anymore.

## Versions

Use Python 3.9, or at least update the `runtime.txt` to match your local version.
That ensures that the Python running on Heroku is the same that you're using.
